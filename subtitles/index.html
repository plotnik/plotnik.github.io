      <h3>Doctor Who - 6x01-02 - The Impossible Astronaut (1)</h3>
      
    &mdash; Out of my way! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; Where's the Doctor?! <br>&mdash; Doctor who? MUFFLED SNEEZE <br>&mdash; You know, this isn't nearly as bad it looks. <br>&mdash; "At the personal intervention of the King, the unnamed doctor <br>&mdash; "was incarcerated without trial in the Tower Of London." <br>&mdash; OK, but it doesn't have to be him. <br>&mdash; "Two nights later a magical sphere some 20 feet across was seen floating away from the tower, <br>&mdash; "bearing the mysterious doctor aloft." <br>&mdash; OK...it's him. <br>&mdash; There's more. <br>&mdash; Doctor, what can you see? <br>&mdash; Is the commandant's office painted a green colour with a big flag on the wall? <br>&mdash; ALARM WAILS <br>&mdash; I think the answer's probably yes. <br>&mdash; DOG BARKS, MAN SHOUTS <br>&mdash; It's like he's being deliberately ridiculous, trying to attract our attention. <br>&mdash; Are you watching this again? I've explained the jokes. <br>&mdash; DOORBELL RINGS So what are you saying? <br>&mdash; Do you really think he's back there trying to wave to us out of history books? <br>&mdash; It's the sort of thing he'd do. Thanks. <br>&mdash; Yeah, but why? He said he'd be in touch. <br>&mdash; Two months ago. Two months is nothing. <br>&mdash; He's up to something, I know he is, I know him. <br>&mdash; What is it? Amy? <br>&mdash; A date, a time, a map reference. <br>&mdash; I think it's an invitation. <br>&mdash; From who? It's not signed. <br>&mdash; Look, TARDIS blue! <br>&mdash; THUNDER CRACKS <br>&mdash; ALARM WAILS You'd better get down here, sir. <br>&mdash; She's doing it again. <br>&mdash; Dr Song, sir. <br>&mdash; She's...packing. <br>&mdash; Says she's going to some planet called...America. <br>&mdash; Thanks! You're very welcome. Uh! <br>&mdash; This is it, yeah? The right place? <br>&mdash; Nowhere, middle of? <br>&mdash; Yeah, this is it. <br>&mdash; Howdy! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; Ha-ha! It's the Ponds! <br>&mdash; Pond One and Pond Two! Hello, Ponds, come here! <br>&mdash; So someone's been a busy boy then, eh? <br>&mdash; Did you see me? Of course! Stalker! <br>&mdash; Flirt! Husband. And Rory the Roman! <br>&mdash; Oh, come here! <br>&mdash; Hey, nice hat. I wear a Stetson now, Stetsons are cool. <br>&mdash; GUNSHOT <br>&mdash; Hello, sweetie. <br>&mdash; Right then, where are we? Have we done Easter Island yet? <br>&mdash; Yes, I've got Easter Island! They worshipped you there! <br>&mdash; Have you seen the statues? Jim The Fish. <br>&mdash; Oh, Jim The Fish! How is he? <br>&mdash; Still building his dam. <br>&mdash; Sorry, what are you two doing? They're both time travellers, so they never meet in the right order. <br>&mdash; They're syncing their diaries. So what's happening, then? <br>&mdash; Because you've been up to something. <br>&mdash; I've been running... faster than I've ever run, <br>&mdash; and I've been running my whole life. <br>&mdash; Now it's time for me to stop. <br>&mdash; And tonight I'm going to need you all with me. <br>&mdash; OK, we're here, what's up? <br>&mdash; A picnic! And then a trip. <br>&mdash; Somewhere different, somewhere brand-new. <br>&mdash; Where? <br>&mdash; Space...1969. <br>&mdash; Salut! Salut! <br>&mdash; Salut! So when are we going to 1969? And since when do you drink wine? <br>&mdash; I'm 1,103 - I must have drunk it some time. <br>&mdash; Oh, wine's horrid! I thought it would taste more like the gums. <br>&mdash; 1,103? You were 908 the last time we saw you. <br>&mdash; You've put on a couple of pounds. I wasn't going to mention it. <br>&mdash; Who's that? Who's who? <br>&mdash; Sorry, what? What did you see? You said you saw someone. <br>&mdash; No, I didn't. Ah! <br>&mdash; The moon, look at it! <br>&mdash; Of course, you lot did more than look, didn't you? <br>&mdash; Big silvery thing in the sky, you couldn't resist it. <br>&mdash; Quite right. <br>&mdash; The moon landing was in '69. <br>&mdash; Is that where we're going? <br>&mdash; Oh, a lot more happens in '69 than anyone remembers. <br>&mdash; Human beings... <br>&mdash; I thought I'd never get done saving you. <br>&mdash; Who's he? <br>&mdash; Oh, my God! <br>&mdash; You all need to stay back. <br>&mdash; Whatever happens now, you do not interfere. <br>&mdash; Clear? <br>&mdash; That's an astronaut. <br>&mdash; That's an Apollo astronaut in the lake. Look. <br>&mdash; Hello. It's OK, I know it's you. <br>&mdash; Well then... <br>&mdash; (What's he doing?) <br>&mdash; GUNSHOT Doctor! <br>&mdash; Amy! Stay back! <br>&mdash; The Doctor said stay back! No! <br>&mdash; You have to stay back! No! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; I'm sorry. <br>&mdash; GUNSHOT <br>&mdash; No! Doctor! <br>&mdash; Doctor, please! <br>&mdash; River... River! <br>&mdash; DEVICE WHIRRS AND BEEPS <br>&mdash; River... <br>&mdash; GUN FIRE <br>&mdash; Of course not. <br>&mdash; River, he can't be dead. This is impossible. <br>&mdash; Whatever that was, it killed him in the middle of his regeneration cycle. <br>&mdash; His body was already dead. <br>&mdash; He didn't make it to the next one. <br>&mdash; Maybe he's a clone or a duplicate or something. <br>&mdash; I believe I can save you some time. <br>&mdash; That most certainly is the Doctor, <br>&mdash; and he is most certainly dead. <br>&mdash; He said you'd need this. <br>&mdash; Gasoline? <br>&mdash; A Time Lord's body is a miracle. <br>&mdash; Even a dead one. <br>&mdash; There are whole empires out there <br>&mdash; who'd rip this world apart for just one cell. <br>&mdash; We can't leave him here. <br>&mdash; Or anywhere. <br>&mdash; Wake up! Go on, wake up, you stupid bloody idiot! <br>&mdash; What do we do, Rory? <br>&mdash; We're his friends. <br>&mdash; We do what the Doctor's friends always do. <br>&mdash; As we're told. <br>&mdash; There's a boat. <br>&mdash; If we're going to do this... let's do it properly. <br>&mdash; Who are you? <br>&mdash; Why did you come? <br>&mdash; MAN: Same reason as you. <br>&mdash; Dr Song... <br>&mdash; Amy... <br>&mdash; Rory. <br>&mdash; I'm Canton Everett Delaware III. <br>&mdash; I won't be seeing you again. <br>&mdash; But...you'll be seeing me. <br>&mdash; Four. <br>&mdash; Sorry, what? <br>&mdash; The Doctor numbered the envelopes. <br>&mdash; You got three, I was two, Mr Delaware was four. <br>&mdash; So? So where's one? <br>&mdash; You think he invited someone else? <br>&mdash; Well, he must have. He planned all of this to the last detail. <br>&mdash; Will you shut up? It doesn't matter. <br>&mdash; He was up to something. He's dead. Space 1969, what did he mean? <br>&mdash; You're still talking, but it doesn't matter. <br>&mdash; Hey, it mattered to him. So it matters to us. <br>&mdash; He's dead. <br>&mdash; But he still needs us. <br>&mdash; I know. <br>&mdash; Amy...I know. <br>&mdash; But right now we have to focus. <br>&mdash; Look. <br>&mdash; Excuse me, who was sitting over there? Some guy. <br>&mdash; The Doctor knew he was going to his death, so he sent out messages. <br>&mdash; When you know it's the end, who do you call? <br>&mdash; Your friends, people you trust. Number one. <br>&mdash; Who did the Doctor trust the most? <br>&mdash; This is cold. <br>&mdash; Even by your standards, this is cold. <br>&mdash; Or, "Hello," as people used to say. <br>&mdash; Doctor? <br>&mdash; I just popped out to get my special straw. <br>&mdash; It adds more fizz. <br>&mdash; You're OK. <br>&mdash; How can you be OK? <br>&mdash; Of course I'm OK, I'm always OK, I'm the king of OK. <br>&mdash; Oh, that's a rubbish title, forget that title. <br>&mdash; Rory the Roman, that's a good title. Hello, Rory! <br>&mdash; And Dr River Song... <br>&mdash; Oh, you bad, bad girl, what trouble have you got for me this time? <br>&mdash; OK. <br>&mdash; I'm assuming that's for something I haven't done yet. <br>&mdash; Yes, it is. Good, looking forward to it. <br>&mdash; I don't understand. <br>&mdash; How can you be here? <br>&mdash; I was invited. <br>&mdash; Date, map reference. Same as you lot, I assume, otherwise it's a hell of a coincidence. <br>&mdash; River, what's going on? Amy, ask him what age he is. <br>&mdash; That's a bit personal. Tell her what age you are. <br>&mdash; 909. Yeah, but you said... <br>&mdash; So where does that leave us? Jim The Fish? <br>&mdash; Have we done Jim The Fish yet? Who's Jim The Fish? <br>&mdash; I don't understand. Yeah, you do. <br>&mdash; I don't! What are we all doing here? <br>&mdash; We've been recruited. Something to do with space, 1969, <br>&mdash; and a man called Canton Everett Delaware III. <br>&mdash; Recruited by who? <br>&mdash; Someone who trusts you more than anybody else in the universe. <br>&mdash; And who's that? <br>&mdash; Spoilers. <br>&mdash; 1969, that's an easy one. <br>&mdash; Funny how some years are easy. <br>&mdash; Now, 1482, full of glitches. <br>&mdash; Now then, Canton Everett Delaware III, that was his name, yeah? <br>&mdash; How many of those can there be? Well, three, I suppose. <br>&mdash; Rory, is everybody cross with me for some reason? <br>&mdash; I'll find out. <br>&mdash; Explain it again. The Doctor we saw on the beach was a future version, <br>&mdash; 200 years older than the one up there. <br>&mdash; But all that'll still happen? He'll still die? We're all going to do that, Amy. <br>&mdash; We're not all going to arrange our own wake and invite ourselves. <br>&mdash; So the Doctor in the future, knowing he's going to die, <br>&mdash; recruits his younger self and all of us to...to what exactly? <br>&mdash; Avenge him? Mm-mm, avenging's not his style. <br>&mdash; Save him. That's not his style either. <br>&mdash; We have to tell him. We've told him all we can. <br>&mdash; We can't even tell him we've seen his future self. <br>&mdash; He's interacted with his own past. It could rip a hole in the universe. <br>&mdash; Except he's done it before. <br>&mdash; In fairness, the universe did blow up. <br>&mdash; But he'd want to know. Would he? Would anyone? <br>&mdash; I'm being extremely clever up here, and there's no-one to stand around, looking impressed. <br>&mdash; What's the point in having you all? <br>&mdash; Couldn't you just slap him sometimes? <br>&mdash; River, we can't just let him die. <br>&mdash; We have to stop it. <br>&mdash; How can you be OK with this? <br>&mdash; The Doctor's death doesn't frighten me, nor does my own. <br>&mdash; There's a far worse day coming for me. <br>&mdash; Time isn't a straight line, it's all bumpy-wumpy. <br>&mdash; There's loads of boring stuff, like Sundays and Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons. <br>&mdash; But now and then there are Saturdays, big temporal tipping points when anything's possible. <br>&mdash; The TARDIS can't resist them, she loves a party, so I give her 1969 and NASA, <br>&mdash; cos that's space in the '60s, and Canton Everett Delaware III, and this is where she's pointing. <br>&mdash; Washington DC, April 8th, 1969. So why haven't we landed? <br>&mdash; Because that's not where we're going. <br>&mdash; Where are we going? Home! Well, you two are. <br>&mdash; Off you pop and make babies. Dr Song, back to prison. <br>&mdash; Me, I'm late for a biplane lesson in 1911, or it could be knitting. <br>&mdash; Knitting or biplanes, one or the other. <br>&mdash; What? <br>&mdash; A mysterious summons? You think I'm just going to go? <br>&mdash; Who sent those messages? <br>&mdash; I know you know, I can see it in your faces. Don't play games with me. <br>&mdash; Don't ever, ever think you're capable of that. <br>&mdash; You're going to have to trust us this time. Trust you? Sure. <br>&mdash; But first of all, Dr Song, just one thing... <br>&mdash; Who are you? <br>&mdash; You're someone from my future, getting that, but who? <br>&mdash; OK... <br>&mdash; Why are you in prison? Who did you kill? Hmm? <br>&mdash; Now, I love a bad girl, me, <br>&mdash; but trust you? <br>&mdash; Seriously? <br>&mdash; Trust me. <br>&mdash; OK. <br>&mdash; You have to do this, and you can't ask why. <br>&mdash; Are you being threatened? Is someone making you say that? <br>&mdash; No. <br>&mdash; You're lying. <br>&mdash; I'm not lying. <br>&mdash; Swear to me. Swear to me on something that matters. <br>&mdash; Fish fingers and custard. <br>&mdash; My life in your hands, Amelia Pond. <br>&mdash; Thank you. <br>&mdash; So! Canton Everett Delaware III! <br>&mdash; Who's he? Who wants to know? <br>&mdash; Your boss. <br>&mdash; I don't have a boss any more. <br>&mdash; Maybe you want to tell that to the President of the United States. <br>&mdash; Ex-FBI, got kicked out. Why? <br>&mdash; I understand you have a problem with authority. Thank you. <br>&mdash; It's not a compliment, son. <br>&mdash; Six weeks after he left the Bureau, the President contacted him for a private meeting. <br>&mdash; Yeah, 1969, who's President? <br>&mdash; This is a personal matter. <br>&mdash; I need someone on the outside, someone with FBI training, <br>&mdash; but is not in contact with them. <br>&mdash; I'm flattered. You were my second choice for this, Mr Delaware. <br>&mdash; That's OK. You were my second choice for President, Mr Nixon. <br>&mdash; 'Richard Milhous Nixon. Vietnam, Watergate,' <br>&mdash; there's some good stuff too. Not enough. <br>&mdash; Hippy! Archaeologist. <br>&mdash; Every day, wherever I am, <br>&mdash; I get a phone call. People can't just call you, Mr President. <br>&mdash; It's a direct call every time. <br>&mdash; Every day for the last two weeks, usually late at night. <br>&mdash; Man or woman? <br>&mdash; Neither. <br>&mdash; Listen. <br>&mdash; OK, since I don't know what I'm getting into, <br>&mdash; I'm being discreet, putting the engines on silent. <br>&mdash; METALLIC SCREECHING <br>&mdash; SCREECHING STOPS <br>&mdash; Did you do something? <br>&mdash; No, just...watching. <br>&mdash; Putting the outer shell on invisible. <br>&mdash; Haven't done this in a while, big drain on the power. <br>&mdash; You can turn the TARDIS invisible? <br>&mdash; Very nearly. <br>&mdash; Er, did you touch something? <br>&mdash; Just admiring your skills, sweetie. <br>&mdash; Good! You might learn something. <br>&mdash; OK. <br>&mdash; Now, I can't check the scanner, it doesn't work when we're cloaked. <br>&mdash; Just give us a mo. <br>&mdash; Whoa, who, whoa, whoa, you lot, wait a moment. <br>&mdash; We're in the middle of the most powerful city in the most powerful country on Earth. <br>&mdash; Let's take it slow. <br>&mdash; PHONE RINGS <br>&mdash; RECORDING: 'Hello? <br>&mdash; 'Who is this? <br>&mdash; 'This is President Nixon. Who's calling? <br>&mdash; 'Is this you again?' <br>&mdash; 'Mr President?' A child? <br>&mdash; 'This is the President, yes. <br>&mdash; 'I'm scared, Mr President. <br>&mdash; 'I'm scared of the Space Man.' <br>&mdash; A little girl? Boy. <br>&mdash; How can you be sure? 'What space man? <br>&mdash; 'Where are you phoning from, where are you right now? Who are you? <br>&mdash; 'Jefferson Adams Hamilton. <br>&mdash; 'Jefferson, listen to me...' <br>&mdash; HANGS UP <br>&mdash; Surely this is something the Bureau could handle, sir? <br>&mdash; These calls happen wherever I am. <br>&mdash; How do I know the Bureau isn't involved? I can't trust any... <br>&mdash; Oh! Hello! <br>&mdash; Bad moment? <br>&mdash; Oh, look, this is the Oval Office. <br>&mdash; I was looking for the... <br>&mdash; Oblong Room. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, just be off then, shall I? <br>&mdash; Every time! Don't worry. <br>&mdash; Always does that when it's cloaked. <br>&mdash; No, stop that! He said the scanner wouldn't work. I know. Bless! <br>&mdash; Ow! Lock down, lock down! <br>&mdash; Not that! Ow! River, have you got my scanner working yet? <br>&mdash; Oh, I hate him! No, you don't. Get the President out of here! <br>&mdash; Sir, you have to go with them now! River, make her blue again! <br>&mdash; What the hell is that? <br>&mdash; Mr President! <br>&mdash; That child just told you everything you need to know, but you weren't listening. <br>&mdash; Never mind, the answer's yes. I'll take the case! <br>&mdash; Fellas, the guns, really? I just walked into the highest security office in the United States, <br>&mdash; parked a big blue box on the rug. You think you can just shoot me? <br>&mdash; They're Americans! Don't shoot, definitely no shooting! Don't shoot us either. <br>&mdash; Very much not in need of getting shot. Look, we've got our hands up. <br>&mdash; Who the hell are you? Sir, you need to stay back. <br>&mdash; But who, but who are they? What is that box? <br>&mdash; It's a Police Box, can't you read? <br>&mdash; I'm your new undercover agent, on loan from Scotland Yard. <br>&mdash; Code name, the Doctor. These are my top operatives, the Legs, the Nose, and Mrs Robinson. I hate you. <br>&mdash; No, you don't! Who are you? <br>&mdash; Boring question. Who's phoning you, that's interesting. <br>&mdash; Cos Canton Three is right, that was definitely a girl's voice. <br>&mdash; There's only one place in America she can be phoning from. Where? <br>&mdash; Do not engage with the intruder, Mr Delaware. You heard everything I heard, <br>&mdash; it's simple enough. I'll explain. <br>&mdash; On the other hand, lay a finger on me, or my friends, and you'll never, ever know. <br>&mdash; How'd you get it in here? I mean, you didn't carry it. <br>&mdash; Clever, eh? Love it. <br>&mdash; Do not compliment the intruder. <br>&mdash; Five minutes? <br>&mdash; Five. Mr President, that man is a clear and present danger. <br>&mdash; Mr President, that man walked in here with a big blue box <br>&mdash; and three of his friends and that's the man he walked past. <br>&mdash; One of them's worth listening to. <br>&mdash; What say we give him five minutes, see if he delivers. Thanks, Canton! <br>&mdash; If he doesn't, I'll shoot him myself. Not so thanks. Sir, I cannot recommend... <br>&mdash; Shut up, Mr Peterson. <br>&mdash; All right. Five minutes. <br>&mdash; I'm going to need a SWAT team ready to mobilise, street level maps covering all of Florida, <br>&mdash; a pot of coffee, 12 jammy dodgers and a fez. <br>&mdash; Get him his maps! <br>&mdash; Why Florida? That's where NASA is. <br>&mdash; She mentioned a space man. NASA's where the space men live. Also... <br>&mdash; there's another lead I'm following. <br>&mdash; Space Man? Like the one we saw at the lake. <br>&mdash; Maybe. <br>&mdash; Probably. <br>&mdash; SINISTER RATTLING <br>&mdash; Who's that? <br>&mdash; (I remember!) Amy? <br>&mdash; What do you remember? <br>&mdash; I don't know, I just... <br>&mdash; Amy, what's wrong? Amy? <br>&mdash; You all right? <br>&mdash; Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm just...feeling a little sick. <br>&mdash; Excuse me, is there a toilet, or something? <br>&mdash; Sorry, ma'am, during this procedure, you must remain here. <br>&mdash; Shut up and take her to the rest room. <br>&mdash; This way, ma'am. Thanks. <br>&mdash; Your five minutes are up. <br>&mdash; Yeah, and where's my fez? <br>&mdash; Actually, I can usually manage this alone. <br>&mdash; RATTLING Oh! <br>&mdash; I saw you before. At the lake... and here. <br>&mdash; But then I forgot. <br>&mdash; How did I forget? <br>&mdash; What are you? <br>&mdash; TOILET FLUSHES <br>&mdash; Get back! Stay back from it! <br>&mdash; Oh, my God, what is that, is that a mask? Is that a Star Trek thing? <br>&mdash; Ben, is that you? <br>&mdash; Get back from it, now! <br>&mdash; Back from what, honey? <br>&mdash; That! <br>&mdash; Oh, my God, look at that. <br>&mdash; Is that a Star Trek mask? <br>&mdash; Ben, that's gotta be you. <br>&mdash; Hang on, did I just say all that? <br>&mdash; No, please, you've got to stay back! <br>&mdash; Back, honey? Back from what? <br>&mdash; Oh, those lights. They never fix them. Look behind you! <br>&mdash; Honey, there is nothing... <br>&mdash; CRACKLING <br>&mdash; You didn't have to kill her, she couldn't even remember you! <br>&mdash; How does that work? We can only remember you, while we're seeing you, is that it? <br>&mdash; Why did you have to kill her? Joy. <br>&mdash; Her name was Joy. <br>&mdash; Your name is Amelia. <br>&mdash; You will tell the Doctor. <br>&mdash; Tell him what? <br>&mdash; What he must know. <br>&mdash; And what he must never know. How do you know about that? <br>&mdash; Tell him. <br>&mdash; Are you OK? <br>&mdash; I'm...I'm fine. <br>&mdash; Much better, thanks. What's that? <br>&mdash; It's my phone. Your phone? <br>&mdash; I have to tell the Doctor. <br>&mdash; Tell him what, ma'am? <br>&mdash; Sorry. I don't know why I said that. <br>&mdash; This way, ma'am. <br>&mdash; PHONE RINGS <br>&mdash; The kid? <br>&mdash; Should I answer it? Here! <br>&mdash; The only place in the United States that call could be coming from. See? Obvious when you think about it. <br>&mdash; You, sir, are a genius. It's a hobby. <br>&mdash; Mr President, answer the phone. <br>&mdash; Hello. <br>&mdash; This is President Nixon. <br>&mdash; 'It's here! The Space Man's here. It's gonna get me. <br>&mdash; 'It's gonna eat me!' There's no time for a SWAT team, let's go! <br>&mdash; Mr President, tell her help's on the way. Canton, <br>&mdash; on no account follow me into this box and close the door behind you. What the hell are you doing? <br>&mdash; METALLIC THRUMMING <br>&mdash; 'Mr President, please help! Please help me!' <br>&mdash; Jefferson, it's all right. <br>&mdash; I'm sending my best people. <br>&mdash; Jefferson isn't a girl's name, or her name either. Jefferson Adams Hamilton... River? <br>&mdash; Surnames of three of America's founding fathers. Lovely fellas, two of them fancied me. <br>&mdash; Are you OK? Coping? <br>&mdash; The President asked the child two questions. Where and who are you? She was answering where. <br>&mdash; It's bigger on the inside. You get used to it. <br>&mdash; Now where would you find three big historical names in a row like that. <br>&mdash; Where? Here! Come on! <br>&mdash; It's er... Are you taking care of this? <br>&mdash; Why's it always my turn? <br>&mdash; Cos you're the newest. <br>&mdash; Where are we? About five miles from Cape Kennedy Space Centre. <br>&mdash; It's 1969, the year of the Moon. <br>&mdash; Interesting, don't you think? <br>&mdash; Why would a girl be here? I don't know. Lost, maybe. <br>&mdash; The President asked where she was and she did what any lost little girl would do. <br>&mdash; She looked out the window. <br>&mdash; Streets. Of course, street names! <br>&mdash; The only place in Florida, probably all of America, <br>&mdash; with those three street names on the same junction, and, Dr Song, you've got that face on again. <br>&mdash; What face? The "he's hot when he's clever" face. This is my normal face. It is. <br>&mdash; Oh, shut up. Not a chance. <br>&mdash; We've moved. How, how can we have moved? <br>&mdash; You haven't even got to space travel yet? <br>&mdash; I was going to cover it with time travel. Time travel? <br>&mdash; Brave heart, Canton. Come on! <br>&mdash; So we're in a box, that's bigger on the inside and it travels through time and space? Basically. <br>&mdash; How long have Scotland Yard had this? <br>&mdash; It's a warehouse of some kind. <br>&mdash; Disused. You realise this is almost certainly a trap, of course. <br>&mdash; I noticed the phone, yes. <br>&mdash; What about it? It was cut off. So how did the child phone from here? <br>&mdash; OK. But why would anyone want to trap us? Don't know. Let's see if anyone tries to kill us, <br>&mdash; and work backwards. <br>&mdash; Now why would a little girl be here? <br>&mdash; I don't know, let's find her and ask her. <br>&mdash; It's non-terrestrial, definitely alien, probably not even from this time zone. <br>&mdash; Which is odd, because... <br>&mdash; look at this! <br>&mdash; It's Earth tech, contemporary. <br>&mdash; Very contemporary. Cutting edge. <br>&mdash; This is from the space programme! Stolen? What, by aliens? <br>&mdash; Apparently. <br>&mdash; Why? If you can make it to Earth, why steal technology that can barely make it to the moon? <br>&mdash; Maybe cos it's cooler. <br>&mdash; Look how cool this stuff is! <br>&mdash; Cool aliens? Well, what would you call me? <br>&mdash; An alien. Oi! <br>&mdash; I, er, I think he's OK now. <br>&mdash; Ah, back with us, Canton? <br>&mdash; Like your wheels. That's my boy! <br>&mdash; So come on - little girl, let's find her. <br>&mdash; River... I know what you're thinking. <br>&mdash; No, you don't. You're thinking if we can find the Space Man in 1969, <br>&mdash; and neutralise it, then it won't be around in 2011 to kill the Doctor. <br>&mdash; OK, lucky guess. <br>&mdash; That's only because I was thinking it too. <br>&mdash; So let's do it. It doesn't work like that. <br>&mdash; We came here because of what we saw in the future. <br>&mdash; If we try and prevent the future from happening, we create a paradox. <br>&mdash; Time can be rewritten. Not all of it. <br>&mdash; Says who? Who do you think? <br>&mdash; What's this? <br>&mdash; We can still save him. Doctor! <br>&mdash; Look at this. <br>&mdash; So where does that go? <br>&mdash; There's a network of tunnels running under here. Life signs? <br>&mdash; No, nothing that's showing up. <br>&mdash; Those are the worst kind. Be careful. <br>&mdash; Careful? Tried that once, ever so dull. <br>&mdash; Shout if you get in trouble. <br>&mdash; Don't worry, I'm quite the screamer. <br>&mdash; Now there's a spoiler for you! <br>&mdash; So what's going on here? <br>&mdash; Nothing... She's just a friend. <br>&mdash; I think he's talking about the possible alien incursion. <br>&mdash; OK. <br>&mdash; DRIPPING WATER <br>&mdash; So... <br>&mdash; ..I was in a bar having a drink. <br>&mdash; Tell me honestly, am I still there? 'Fraid not. <br>&mdash; OUT OF BREATH <br>&mdash; All clear. <br>&mdash; Just tunnels, nothing down there I can see. <br>&mdash; Er, give me five minutes, I want to take another look round. <br>&mdash; Stupidly dangerous. <br>&mdash; Yep, I like it too. <br>&mdash; Amy, look after him. <br>&mdash; Rory, would you mind going with her? <br>&mdash; Yeah, a bit. <br>&mdash; Then I appreciate it all the more. <br>&mdash; Hang on, River, I'm coming too. <br>&mdash; You OK? Ah yes, yes. <br>&mdash; I just felt a bit sick. <br>&mdash; It's the prison food probably. <br>&mdash; OK. <br>&mdash; This way, what do you think? <br>&mdash; QUIET RATTLING <br>&mdash; < SCURRYING <br>&mdash; I keep thinking I hear things. Interesting! These tunnels are old. <br>&mdash; Really old. <br>&mdash; How can they be really old and nobody notice them? <br>&mdash; It's a maintenance hatch. It's locked. <br>&mdash; Why do people always lock things? <br>&mdash; What's through there? No idea. <br>&mdash; Something bad? Almost definitely. <br>&mdash; You're going to open it, aren't you? <br>&mdash; It's locked. How's a girl supposed to resist? <br>&mdash; Is this sensible? God, I hope not. <br>&mdash; You and the Doctor... I can kind of picture it. <br>&mdash; Keep a look out. <br>&mdash; What did you mean? <br>&mdash; What you said to Amy. <br>&mdash; There's a worse day coming for you. <br>&mdash; When I first met the Doctor, <br>&mdash; a long, long time ago... <br>&mdash; ..he knew all about me. <br>&mdash; Think about that. Impressionable young girl, and suddenly this man <br>&mdash; just drops out of the sky, <br>&mdash; he's clever and mad and wonderful and knows every last thing about her. <br>&mdash; Imagine what that does to a girl. <br>&mdash; I don't really have to. <br>&mdash; Trouble is, it's all back to front. <br>&mdash; My past is his future. <br>&mdash; We're travelling in opposite directions. <br>&mdash; Every time we meet, I know him more, <br>&mdash; he knows me less. <br>&mdash; I live for the days when I see him. <br>&mdash; But I know that every time I do, <br>&mdash; he'll be one step further away. <br>&mdash; And the day's coming, when I'll look into that man's eyes... <br>&mdash; ..my Doctor... <br>&mdash; ..and he won't have the faintest idea who I am. <br>&mdash; ELECTRICAL WHIR <br>&mdash; And I think it's going to kill me. <br>&mdash; DOOR CREAKS <br>&mdash; What is this place? <br>&mdash; KLAXON That's an alarm. <br>&mdash; Check if anything's coming. <br>&mdash; RATTLING <br>&mdash; There's nothing out there. <br>&mdash; WHOOSHING <br>&mdash; These tunnels, they're not just here, they're everywhere. <br>&mdash; They're running under the surface of the entire planet! <br>&mdash; They've been here for centuries! <br>&mdash; CRACKLING <br>&mdash; RATTLING <br>&mdash; Rory! <br>&mdash; So, you were kicked out of the FBI cos you had attitude problems. <br>&mdash; No. I just wanted to get married. <br>&mdash; Is that a crime? <br>&mdash; Yes. <br>&mdash; Doctor who, exactly? <br>&mdash; That's classified. Classified by who? <br>&mdash; God knows. <br>&mdash; But you work for him. He's my friend. <br>&mdash; If "friend" is the right word. <br>&mdash; I haven't seen him in a while. <br>&mdash; I had something I wanted to tell him, <br>&mdash; but stuff always gets in the way. <br>&mdash; Stuff does that. <br>&mdash; GIRL: Help me! <br>&mdash; Help! Help me! It's her! <br>&mdash; Oh! Amy? <br>&mdash; What's wrong? I need to tell you something! <br>&mdash; It's important. It's really, really important. <br>&mdash; Doctor! Quickly! What, now? <br>&mdash; Canton! Canton, are you OK? <br>&mdash; Is he all right? Just unconscious. Got a proper whack though. <br>&mdash; Doctor, I need to tell you something. <br>&mdash; I have to tell you it now! Not a great moment, Amy. No, it's important, it has to be now! <br>&mdash; GIRL: Help! Help me! <br>&mdash; Help me! Doctor... <br>&mdash; ..I'm pregnant. <br>&mdash; THUDDING <br>&mdash; That's it. The astronaut! <br>&mdash; Help me! <br>&mdash; Get down! What are you doing! Saving your life! No! <br>&mdash; AMY SCREAMS <br>&mdash; I'm sorry! I didn't mean to shoot you. <br>&mdash; '30 seconds and counting. We are still go with Apollo 11.' <br>&mdash; They are everywhere. It's like they edit themselves out of your memory as soon as you look away. <br>&mdash; '20 seconds and counting.' <br>&mdash; We still don't know what they look like. <br>&mdash; As long as there's been something in the corner of your eye <br>&mdash; or creaking in your house or voices through a wall. <br>&mdash; 'T minus ten.' We are not fighting an alien invasion. <br>&mdash; We're leading a revolution. 'Five, four, three, <br>&mdash; 'two, one. <br>&mdash; 'Good luck and God speed.' <br></div></body></html>
