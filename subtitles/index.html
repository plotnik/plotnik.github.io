      <h3>Doctor Who - 5x14 - Episode 14</h3>
      
    &mdash; 'Would all passengers please return to their seats and fasten their safety belts? <br>&mdash; 'We are experiencing slight turbulence.' <br>&mdash; Both engines failed, and the storm-gate's critical. <br>&mdash; The ship is going down! Christmas is cancelled. <br>&mdash; Entering atmosphere now! <br>&mdash; Level - keep her level! Level with what? I can't see! <br>&mdash; What is that stuff? <br>&mdash; Clouds? <br>&mdash; What kind of clouds? <br>&mdash; Are you sending a distress signal? It's not me! <br>&mdash; Who's in the honeymoon suite? <br>&mdash; I've sent for help. Who the hell are you? <br>&mdash; Look, there's a friend of mine, OK, and he can help us, he'll come! <br>&mdash; And what ARE you wearing? <br>&mdash; That doesn't matter. <br>&mdash; Are you from the honeymoon suite? Oh, shut up! <br>&mdash; Amy, the light's stopped flashing... Does that mean he's coming? <br>&mdash; Honeymoon suite? Oh, oh, the clothes, um... <br>&mdash; It is just a bit of fun. Really, shut up! <br>&mdash; Sensor-loss on 80% of the hull... <br>&mdash; So does this mean he's coming? Or does it mean I need to change the bulb? <br>&mdash; He'll come. He always comes. Right, well, he is cutting it kind of fine! <br>&mdash; If we can't stabilise the orbit, we're finished. <br>&mdash; There's nothing to lock onto. I am flying blind. <br>&mdash; Come on, Doctor, come on... <br>&mdash; There's something coming alongside us. Something small, like a shuttle. <br>&mdash; Just this once, don't be late. Ma'am...incoming message. <br>&mdash; It's from the other ship. On screen. <br>&mdash; What does that mean? It's Christmas! <br>&mdash; 'On every world, wherever people are, <br>&mdash; 'in the deepest part of the winter, at the exact mid-point... <br>&mdash; 'everybody stops and turns and hugs. <br>&mdash; 'As if to say, "Well done. <br>&mdash; ' "Well done, everyone... <br>&mdash; ' "we're halfway out of the dark." <br>&mdash; 'Back on Earth, we called this Christmas. <br>&mdash; 'Or the Winter Solstice.' <br>&mdash; On this world, the first settlers called it the Crystal Feast. <br>&mdash; You know what I call it? <br>&mdash; I call it expecting something for nothing! <br>&mdash; Sir. Mr Sardick. <br>&mdash; We're only asking for one day. <br>&mdash; Just let her out for Christmas. <br>&mdash; She loves Christmas. Does she? <br>&mdash; Oh, does she? I see! <br>&mdash; Hello! <br>&mdash; Wakey-wakey - it's Christmas! <br>&mdash; Do you know what? I think she's a bit cool about the whole thing. <br>&mdash; That was funny. <br>&mdash; She's frozen. <br>&mdash; She's what, sorry? <br>&mdash; She's in the ice, she can't hear you. <br>&mdash; Oh, what a clever little boy. <br>&mdash; You must be so irritated. <br>&mdash; How much? Er...it's 4,500 Gideons, sir. <br>&mdash; You took a loan of 4,500 Gideons... <br>&mdash; and Little Miss Christmas is my security. <br>&mdash; We're not asking for her back. Just let her have one day. <br>&mdash; Let her have Christmas with us. <br>&mdash; Sir, it's the President. <br>&mdash; Tell him I'm busy. <br>&mdash; Now...where were we? <br>&mdash; Oh, yes! She's pretty, though, your daughter. <br>&mdash; Maybe I should keep her. She's not my daughter, sir. <br>&mdash; She's my sister. <br>&mdash; She volunteered for the ice when the family were in difficulties many years ago. <br>&mdash; Sorry, sir, the President says there's a galaxy-class ship trapped <br>&mdash; in the cloud layer and...well, we have to let it land. Or? <br>&mdash; Well...or it'll crash, sir. <br>&mdash; Oh. Well, it's a kind of landing, isn't it? <br>&mdash; It's from Earth, sir, registering over 4,000 life forms on board. <br>&mdash; Not if we wait a bit! <br>&mdash; You can't just let it crash, sir. <br>&mdash; Says who? <br>&mdash; Oh, give it here. <br>&mdash; Look, petal, we already have a surplus population. <br>&mdash; No more people allowed on this planet. <br>&mdash; I don't make the rules. Oh, no, hang on... I do. <br>&mdash; Right, you lot... <br>&mdash; poor, begging people, <br>&mdash; off home and pray for a miracle. <br>&mdash; Ah! Yes, blimey. Sorry! <br>&mdash; Christmas Eve on a rooftop, saw a chimney, my whole brain just went, "What the hell!" <br>&mdash; Don't worry, fat fella will be doing the rounds later. <br>&mdash; I'm just scoping out the general...chimney-ness. Yes. <br>&mdash; Nice size, good traction... <br>&mdash; big tick! Fat fella? <br>&mdash; Father Christmas, Santa Claus...or, as I've always known him, Jeff. <br>&mdash; There's no such person as Father Christmas. <br>&mdash; Oh, yeah? Me and Father Christmas, Frank Sinatra's hunting lodge, 1952. <br>&mdash; See him at the back with the blonde...Albert Einstein. <br>&mdash; The three of us together...hrrroom! Watch out! <br>&mdash; OK? Keep the faith, stay off the naughty list. <br>&mdash; Ooh! Now, what's this? <br>&mdash; And I love this, a big flashy lighty thing - that's what brought me here. <br>&mdash; Big flashy lighty things have got me written all over them. <br>&mdash; Not actually, but give me time and a crayon. <br>&mdash; Now, this big flashy lighty thing is connected to the spire in your dome, yeah, <br>&mdash; and it controls the sky. <br>&mdash; Well, technically, it controls the clouds, which technically aren't clouds at all. <br>&mdash; Well, they're clouds of tiny particles of ice. <br>&mdash; Ice clouds, love that, who's she? <br>&mdash; Nobody important. Nobody important? <br>&mdash; Blimey, that's amazing. <br>&mdash; Do you know, in 900 years of time and space, <br>&mdash; I've never met anyone who wasn't important before. <br>&mdash; Now, this console is the key to saving that ship, or I'll eat my hat... <br>&mdash; If I had a hat. <br>&mdash; I'll eat someone's hat. <br>&mdash; Not someone who's using their hat - I don't want to shock a nun, or something. <br>&mdash; Sorry, rambling, cos...cos this isn't working! <br>&mdash; The controls are isomorphic - one to one - they respond only to me. <br>&mdash; Oh, you fibber... <br>&mdash; Isomorphic! There's no such thing. <br>&mdash; These controls are isomorphic! <br>&mdash; The skies of this entire world are mine. <br>&mdash; My family tamed them, and now I own them. <br>&mdash; Tamed the sky? <br>&mdash; What does that mean? It means I'm Kazran Sardick. <br>&mdash; How can you possibly not know who I am? <br>&mdash; Well, just easily bored, I suppose. <br>&mdash; So, I need your help, then. <br>&mdash; Make an appointment. <br>&mdash; There are 4,003 people in a spaceship trapped in your cloud belt. <br>&mdash; Without your help, they're going to die. <br>&mdash; Yes. <br>&mdash; You don't have to let that happen. <br>&mdash; I know, but I'm going to. <br>&mdash; Bye-bye. Bored now. ..Chuck! <br>&mdash; Ooh, look at you, looking all tough now. There are 4,003 people <br>&mdash; I won't allow to die tonight. Do you know where that puts you? Where? <br>&mdash; 4,004. <br>&mdash; Was that a sort of threat-y thing? <br>&mdash; Whatever happens tonight, remember... <br>&mdash; you brought it on yourself. <br>&mdash; Yeah, yeah, right. ..Get him out of here. <br>&mdash; And next time, try and find me some funny poor people. <br>&mdash; No, stop, don't! Don't you dare! You leave him! <br>&mdash; Get him out of here! <br>&mdash; Get that foul-smelling family out of here! Out! <br>&mdash; We're going! <br>&mdash; What? What do you want? <br>&mdash; A simple life. <br>&mdash; But you didn't hit the boy. Well, I will next time! <br>&mdash; No, you see, you won't. Now why? <br>&mdash; What am I missing? <br>&mdash; Get out! Get out of this house! <br>&mdash; The chairs! Of course, the chairs! Stupid me, the chairs! The chairs? <br>&mdash; There's a portrait on the wall behind me. <br>&mdash; Looks like you, but it's too old, so it's your father. <br>&mdash; All the chairs are angled away from it. Daddy's been dead for 20 years. <br>&mdash; But you still can't get comfortable where he can see you. <br>&mdash; There's a Christmas tree in the painting, but none in this house, on Christmas Eve. <br>&mdash; You're scared of him and you're scared of being like him. <br>&mdash; And good for you, you're not like him, not really. Do you know why? <br>&mdash; Why? <br>&mdash; Because you didn't hit the boy. <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas, Mr Sardick. <br>&mdash; I despise Christmas! <br>&mdash; You shouldn't. It's very you. <br>&mdash; It's what? What do you mean? <br>&mdash; Halfway out of the dark. <br>&mdash; Get her downstairs with the others. Clean up this mess! <br>&mdash; Everything's offline! Secondary furnace just vented. <br>&mdash; Have you got a plan yet? Yes, I do. <br>&mdash; Are you lying? <br>&mdash; Yes, I am. Don't treat me like an idiot. <br>&mdash; Was he lying? No, no. <br>&mdash; OK, the good news. I've tracked the machine that unlocks the cloud belt. <br>&mdash; I could use it to clear you a flight corridor and you could land easily. <br>&mdash; Oh, hey, hey, that's great news. <br>&mdash; But I can't control the machine. Less great. <br>&mdash; But I've met a man who can. Ah, well, there you go! <br>&mdash; And he hates me. Were you being extra charming and clever? <br>&mdash; Yeah, how did you know? Lucky guess. <br>&mdash; Sir... Sir. Hang on. <br>&mdash; I've never seen anybody stand up to Mr Sardick like that. <br>&mdash; Bless you, sir, and merry Christmas. <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas. Lovely. Sorry, bit busy. You'd better get inside, sir. <br>&mdash; The fog's thick tonight, and there's a fish warning. Oh, right, yeah. <br>&mdash; Sorry, fish? <br>&mdash; Yeah. You know what they're like when they get a bit hungry. <br>&mdash; Yeah, fish, I know fish. Fish? <br>&mdash; It's all Mr Sardick's fault, I reckon. <br>&mdash; He always lets a few fish through the cloud layer when he's in a bad mood. <br>&mdash; Thank you. Bless you once again, sir. <br>&mdash; Fish? <br>&mdash; Doctor, the Captain says we've got less than an hour... <br>&mdash; 'What should we be doing?' <br>&mdash; Fish...! 'Sorry, what?' <br>&mdash; Fish that can swim in fog. <br>&mdash; I love new planets. 'Doctor!' <br>&mdash; Doctor, please don't get distracted! <br>&mdash; Now, why would people be frightened of you tiny little fellas? <br>&mdash; Look at you, sweet little fishy-wishies. <br>&mdash; Mind you, fish in the fog, so the cloud cover... Ooh. <br>&mdash; Careful up there. Oh, great, thanks, Doctor, <br>&mdash; because there was a real danger we were all going to nod off(!) <br>&mdash; We've got less than an hour! <br>&mdash; I know. # Ding dong! Merrily on high... # <br>&mdash; Doctor? How are you getting us off here? Oh, just give me a minute! <br>&mdash; Can't use the TARDIS, cos it can't lock on. <br>&mdash; So that ship needs to land, but it can't land unless <br>&mdash; a very bad man suddenly decides to turn nice, just in time for Christmas Day! <br>&mdash; Doctor, I can't hear you. What is that? Is that singing? <br>&mdash; A Christmas carol. A what? <br>&mdash; A Christmas carol! A what? <br>&mdash; A CHRISTMAS CAROL! <br>&mdash; # ..Hosanna in excelsis... # <br>&mdash; 'Doctor?' <br>&mdash; # ..Glo-o-ria... # <br>&mdash; Kazran Sardick! 'Doctor!' <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas, Kazran Sardick! <br>&mdash; # ..Hosanna in excelsis. # <br>&mdash; 'Hello. My name is Kazran Sardick. <br>&mdash; 'I'm 12½, and this is my bedroom. <br>&mdash; 'Top secret special project. <br>&mdash; 'This is my top secret special project. <br>&mdash; 'For my eyes only. Merry Christmas. Kazran, Kazran! <br>&mdash; 'Kazran, what are you doing? <br>&mdash; 'What are you doing?! <br>&mdash; 'I've warned you before about this, you stupid, ignorant, ridiculous child! <br>&mdash; 'I was just going to make a film of the fish. <br>&mdash; 'The fish are dangerous! <br>&mdash; 'I just want to see them. <br>&mdash; 'Don't be stupid, you're far too young! <br>&mdash; 'Everyone at school's seen the fish. <br>&mdash; 'That's enough! You'll be singing to them next, like gypsies. <br>&mdash; 'The singing works! I've seen it. The fish like the singing. <br>&mdash; 'What does it matter what fish like? <br>&mdash; 'People say we don't have to be afraid of the fish. <br>&mdash; They're not really interested in us. <br>&mdash; 'You don't listen to people! You listen to me!' <br>&mdash; 'Ow! <br>&mdash; 'I'm sorry, Father. This is my house!' <br>&mdash; It's OK. It's OK. What have you done? What is this? <br>&mdash; Found it on an old drive. Sorry about the picture quality, <br>&mdash; had to recover the data using quantum enfolding and a paperclip. <br>&mdash; Oh, I wouldn't bother calling your servants, they quit. <br>&mdash; Apparently they won the lottery at exactly the same time, <br>&mdash; which is a bit lucky when you think about it. <br>&mdash; There isn't a lottery. Yeah, as I say, lucky. <br>&mdash; 'There's a fog warning tonight. You keep these windows closed, understand? Closed!' <br>&mdash; Who are you? <br>&mdash; Tonight, I'm the Ghost Of Christmas Past. <br>&mdash; 'Mrs Mantovani will be looking after you tonight. <br>&mdash; 'You stay here till she comes.' <br>&mdash; 'Do you understand? Do you understand?' <br>&mdash; Did you ever get to see a fish back then, when you were a kid? <br>&mdash; What does that matter to you? <br>&mdash; Look how it mattered to you. <br>&mdash; I cried all night, <br>&mdash; and I learned life's most invaluable lesson. <br>&mdash; Which is? Nobody comes. <br>&mdash; Get out! Get out of my house! OK. <br>&mdash; OK. But I'll be back. <br>&mdash; Way back. <br>&mdash; Way, way back. <br>&mdash; See? Back! <br>&mdash; 'Who are you? Hi. I'm the Doctor. I'm your new babysitter. <br>&mdash; 'Where's Mrs Mantovani? Oh, you'll never guess! <br>&mdash; 'Clever old Mrs Manters, she only went and won the lottery!' <br>&mdash; There isn't any lottery! <br>&mdash; 'There isn't any lottery. I know. What a woman! <br>&mdash; 'If you're my babysitter, why are you climbing in the window? <br>&mdash; 'Cos if I was climbing out, I'd be going in the wrong direction. Pay attention. <br>&mdash; 'Mrs Mantovani's always my babysitter. Times change. <br>&mdash; 'Wouldn't you say? You see... <br>&mdash; 'Christmas Past. <br>&mdash; 'Who are you talking to? You. <br>&mdash; 'Now, your past is going to change. <br>&mdash; 'That means your memories will too. Scary, but you'll get the hang of it. <br>&mdash; 'I don't understand. I'll bet you don't! <br>&mdash; 'I wish I could see your face.' <br>&mdash; But that never happened. <br>&mdash; But it did! <br>&mdash; Right, then. Your bedroom. Great! <br>&mdash; Let's see, you're 12 years old, so we'll stay away from under the bed. <br>&mdash; Cupboard! Big cupboard, I love a cupboard. <br>&mdash; Do you know, there's a thing called a face spider. <br>&mdash; It's just like a tiny baby's head with spider legs, <br>&mdash; and it's specifically evolved to scuttle up the backs of bedroom cupboards... <br>&mdash; ..which, yeah, I probably shouldn't have mentioned. <br>&mdash; Right, so what are we going to do? <br>&mdash; Eat crisps and talk about girls? <br>&mdash; I've never actually done that, but I bet it's easy. Girls! Yeah? <br>&mdash; Are you really a babysitter? <br>&mdash; I think you'll find I'm universally recognised <br>&mdash; as a mature and responsible adult. <br>&mdash; It's just a lot of wavy lines. <br>&mdash; Yeah, it's shorted out. Finally, a lie too big. <br>&mdash; OK, no, not really a babysitter, but it's Christmas Eve. <br>&mdash; You don't want a real one, you want me. Why? <br>&mdash; What's so special about you? Have you ever seen Mary Poppins? <br>&mdash; No. Good. Cos that comparison would've been rubbish. <br>&mdash; Fish in the fog, fish in the clouds. <br>&mdash; How do people ever get bored? How did boredom even get invented? <br>&mdash; My dad's invented a machine to control the cloud belt. <br>&mdash; Tame the sky, he says. <br>&mdash; The fish'll be able to come down, but only when we let them. <br>&mdash; We can charge whatever we like. <br>&mdash; Yeah. I've seen your dad's machine. <br>&mdash; What? You can't have. <br>&mdash; Tame the sky... <br>&mdash; Human beings, you always manage to find the boring alternative, don't you? <br>&mdash; You want to see one? A fish. <br>&mdash; We can do that. We can see a fish. <br>&mdash; Aren't you going to tell me it's dangerous? <br>&mdash; Dangerous?! Come on, we're boys! <br>&mdash; And you know what boys say in the face of danger. <br>&mdash; What? Mummy! <br>&mdash; Are there any face spiders in here? <br>&mdash; Nah, not at this time of night. <br>&mdash; They'll all be sleeping in your mattress. <br>&mdash; So why are you so interested in fish? <br>&mdash; Cos they're scary. Good answer. <br>&mdash; What kind of tie is that? A cool one. <br>&mdash; Why is it cool? <br>&mdash; Why are you REALLY interested in fish? <br>&mdash; My school. <br>&mdash; During the last fog belt, the nets broke and there was an attack. <br>&mdash; Loads of them, a whole shoal. <br>&mdash; No-one was hurt, but it was the most fish ever seen below the mountains. <br>&mdash; Were you scared? <br>&mdash; I wasn't there. <br>&mdash; I was off sick. Ooh, lucky you. <br>&mdash; Not lucky? <br>&mdash; It's all anyone ever talks about now, <br>&mdash; the day the fish came. <br>&mdash; Everyone's got a story. <br>&mdash; But you don't. <br>&mdash; 'I see. <br>&mdash; 'Why are you recording this? Do you pay attention at school, Kazran?' <br>&mdash; Sorry, what? Cos you're not paying attention now. <br>&mdash; Ssh! <br>&mdash; Now I remember. <br>&mdash; No, Doctor, you mustn't! <br>&mdash; Doctor, are you sure? Trust me. <br>&mdash; OK. Oi! <br>&mdash; Eyes on the tie. Look at me. I wear it and I don't care. <br>&mdash; Trust me? Yes. <br>&mdash; Yes. <br>&mdash; That's why it's cool. <br>&mdash; Hello, fishy. <br>&mdash; Let's see. <br>&mdash; Interesting. <br>&mdash; Crystalline fog, eh? <br>&mdash; Maybe carrying a tiny electrical charge. <br>&mdash; Is that how you fly, little fishy? <br>&mdash; What is it? What kind? Can I see? <br>&mdash; Just stay there a moment. <br>&mdash; Is it big? Nah, just a little one. <br>&mdash; So, little fella, what do you eat? <br>&mdash; How little? Erm... Can I come out? <br>&mdash; No, no. <br>&mdash; Maybe just...wait there for a moment. <br>&mdash; What colour is it? <br>&mdash; Big. Big colour. <br>&mdash; What's happening? Well, concentrating on the plusses, <br>&mdash; you've definitely got a story of your own now. <br>&mdash; Also, I got a good look at the fish, <br>&mdash; and I understand the fog, which'll help me land a spaceship <br>&mdash; in the future, and save a lot of lives. <br>&mdash; And I'll get some readings off my sonic screwdriver <br>&mdash; when I get it off the shark in your bedroom. <br>&mdash; There's a shark in my bedroom? <br>&mdash; Oh, fine, focus on that part! <br>&mdash; Has it gone? What's it doing? <br>&mdash; What do you call it if you don't have any feet, <br>&mdash; and you're taking a run-up? <br>&mdash; No! <br>&mdash; It's going to eat us. <br>&mdash; It's going to eat us, <br>&mdash; it's going to eat us, it's going to eat us... Is it going to eat us? <br>&mdash; Maybe we're going to eat it, but I don't like the odds. <br>&mdash; It's stuck, though. Let's see. <br>&mdash; Tiny brain. If I had my screwdriver, I could probably stun it. <br>&mdash; Well, where's your screwdriver? <br>&mdash; Well, concentrating on the plusses... <br>&mdash; within reach. There's a real chance, the way it's wedged in the doorway, <br>&mdash; of keeping its mouth open. There is? Agree with me. <br>&mdash; Cos I've only got two goes, and then it's your turn. Two goes? <br>&mdash; Two arms. Right, then! OK. Geronimo! <br>&mdash; Open wide! <br>&mdash; What's the big fishy done to you? <br>&mdash; Swallowed half of you, that's what. Half a screwdriver, what use is that? <br>&mdash; Bad, big fishy. <br>&mdash; Doctor? <br>&mdash; I think she's dying. <br>&mdash; Half my screwdriver's still inside, <br>&mdash; but yeah, I think so. I doubt they can survive long outside the cloud belt. <br>&mdash; Just quick raiding trips on a foggy night. <br>&mdash; Can't we get it back up there? <br>&mdash; We were just going to stun it. <br>&mdash; I didn't want to kill it. <br>&mdash; She was trying to eat you. <br>&mdash; She was hungry. <br>&mdash; 'I'm sorry, Kazran. <br>&mdash; 'I can't save her.' <br>&mdash; I could take her back up there, but she'd never survive the trip. <br>&mdash; We need a fully functioning life-support. <br>&mdash; You mean like an icebox? OK. <br>&mdash; Ooh, a tree! <br>&mdash; What is this? <br>&mdash; The surplus population. <br>&mdash; That's what my dad calls it. <br>&mdash; Oh, it's not turning! Oh, why won't it turn? <br>&mdash; Ah, what's the number? <br>&mdash; 7258. <br>&mdash; I don't know! This place is full of alarms, it's not just the door. <br>&mdash; I need the number! <br>&mdash; 7258! <br>&mdash; I need the number! I'm not allowed to know until I'm older. <br>&mdash; 7258! <br>&mdash; Just what I was after. Thank you! <br>&mdash; 7258. 7258. <br>&mdash; Ah, there's fish down here, too. <br>&mdash; Yeah, but only tiny ones. <br>&mdash; The house is built on a fog lake. <br>&mdash; That's how Dad freezes the people. <br>&mdash; They're all full, but we could borrow one. <br>&mdash; Yeah, this one. <br>&mdash; Hello again. <br>&mdash; You know her? <br>&mdash; Why her? <br>&mdash; Important, is she? <br>&mdash; She won't mind. She loves the fish. <br>&mdash; 'My name is Abigail Pettigrew, <br>&mdash; and I'm very grateful for Mr Sardick's kindness. My father...' <br>&mdash; She starts to talk about the fish in a minute. <br>&mdash; '..but I would not allow it. <br>&mdash; 'I could not have chosen this path were it not for the compassion and generosity <br>&mdash; 'of the great philanthropist and patron of the poor, <br>&mdash; 'Mr Elliot Sardick, <br>&mdash; 'but I'm also surrounded by the fish, the beautiful, iridescent, magical fish...' <br>&mdash; Why are these people here? <br>&mdash; '..they catch the light as they dart through the fog...' <br>&mdash; What's all this for? <br>&mdash; My dad lends money. <br>&mdash; He always takes a family member as... He calls it security. <br>&mdash; Hard man to love, your dad. <br>&mdash; But I suppose you know that. <br>&mdash; '..I am not alone, and I am at peace.' <br>&mdash; What's wrong? <br>&mdash; Just my half a screwdriver trying to repair itself. <br>&mdash; It's signalling the other half. <br>&mdash; The other half's inside the shark. <br>&mdash; Yeah. <br>&mdash; Sounds like she's woken up. <br>&mdash; OK. So it's homing on the screwdriver... <br>&mdash; Run! <br>&mdash; Run! <br>&mdash; # In the bleak midwinter <br>&mdash; # Frosty wind made moan <br>&mdash; # Earth stood hard as iron <br>&mdash; # Water like a stone <br>&mdash; # Snow had fallen <br>&mdash; # Snow on snow <br>&mdash; # Snow on snow <br>&mdash; # In the bleak midwinter <br>&mdash; # Long ago... # <br>&mdash; It's not really the singing, of course. <br>&mdash; Yes, it is. <br>&mdash; Nah. The fish love the singing, it's true. <br>&mdash; Nah. The notes resonate in the ice, causing a delta wave pattern in the fog. <br>&mdash; Ow! A fish bit me. <br>&mdash; Shut up, then! <br>&mdash; # Heaven and earth shall... # <br>&mdash; Of course! That's how the machine controls the cloud belt. <br>&mdash; The clouds are ice crystals. <br>&mdash; If you vibrate them at the right frequency, you could align them... <br>&mdash; Ow! Why do they keep biting me? <br>&mdash; Look, the fish like the singing, OK? <br>&mdash; Now shut up! OK. <br>&mdash; # The ox and ass and camel <br>&mdash; # Which adore... # <br>&mdash; It's bigger on... <br>&mdash; ..the inside. Yeah, it's the colour. <br>&mdash; Really knocks the walls back. <br>&mdash; Shark in a box, to go. <br>&mdash; Abigail. <br>&mdash; This is...amazing! <br>&mdash; Nah, this is transport. <br>&mdash; I keep amazing... <br>&mdash; ..out here. <br>&mdash; Come on, then, let's get this shark out. <br>&mdash; Hey, look at her go! <br>&mdash; Abigail, this number, what does it mean? <br>&mdash; It pertains to me, sir, not the fish. Yeah, but how? <br>&mdash; You are a doctor, you say? <br>&mdash; Are you one of mine? <br>&mdash; Do you need a doctor? <br>&mdash; Ah! Sorry! <br>&mdash; Time's up, kids! Why? <br>&mdash; It's nearly Christmas Day! <br>&mdash; If you should ever wish to visit again... <br>&mdash; Well, you know, if I'm ever in the neighbourhood... <br>&mdash; He comes every Christmas Eve. What? <br>&mdash; Yeah, he does, every time. He promises! No, I don't... <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas! Doctor! <br>&mdash; What are we going to do? <br>&mdash; The Doctor's got a great plan! Wait till you hear! <br>&mdash; You are out of your mind. This will never work! <br>&mdash; Oh, don't think shark, think dolphin. <br>&mdash; A shark isn't a dolphin! It's nearly a dolphin. <br>&mdash; No, it isn't. That's where you're wrong, because... Shut up. <br>&mdash; It could be anywhere. <br>&mdash; Will it really come? No chance. Completely impossible. <br>&mdash; Except at Christmas. <br>&mdash; How are we going to get back? I don't know! <br>&mdash; Do you have a plan? I don't know! <br>&mdash; Woo-hoo! <br>&mdash; Woooo! <br>&mdash; Best Christmas Eve ever! Till the next one! <br>&mdash; New memories. <br>&mdash; How can I have new memories? <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas! Doctor! <br>&mdash; Where to this time? <br>&mdash; Did I mention, at any point, all of time and space...? <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas! Doctor! <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas! Doctor! <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas! <br>&mdash; Kazran! <br>&mdash; You've grown. <br>&mdash; Yeah. <br>&mdash; And now you're blushing. <br>&mdash; Sorry. That's OK. <br>&mdash; So, Doctor, where this time? Pick a Christmas Eve. <br>&mdash; I've got them all right here. Might I make a request? <br>&mdash; Of course. <br>&mdash; This one. <br>&mdash; Thank you, darling. <br>&mdash; Who are they? Her family. <br>&mdash; The lady's her sister. <br>&mdash; I met her once, when she was...older. <br>&mdash; Abigail's crying. <br>&mdash; Yes. <br>&mdash; When girls are crying, are you supposed to talk to them? <br>&mdash; I have absolutely no idea. <br>&mdash; My sister's family. <br>&mdash; They're so happy. <br>&mdash; They look very poor. <br>&mdash; They are very poor. Doesn't mean you can't be happy. <br>&mdash; And then why aren't you? <br>&mdash; Because this is the life I can never have. <br>&mdash; Why not? <br>&mdash; I think you're blushing again. <br>&mdash; Come in. <br>&mdash; Pick a card, any card at all. <br>&mdash; Every Christmas Eve. <br>&mdash; I don't understand. I'm not sure I do. <br>&mdash; Memorise the card, put it back in the deck. Don't let me see it. <br>&mdash; Is this what it looked like last year? <br>&mdash; It doesn't have to be exactly the same. <br>&mdash; I'm starting again. <br>&mdash; Come on, Kazran, we're starting again. <br>&mdash; That's Sardick's boy, isn't it? <br>&mdash; He's not like his father. His father treats everyone like cattle. <br>&mdash; One day, that boy will do the same. No. He's different. <br>&mdash; The three of clubs. No. <br>&mdash; You sure? I'm very good at card tricks. It wasn't the three of clubs. <br>&mdash; Well, of course it wasn't, because it was the seven of diamonds! No. <br>&mdash; Oi, stop it, you're doing it wrong. <br>&mdash; I see him around the town sometimes. Never any friends. He's got me. <br>&mdash; All those Christmas Eves, you never once came to see us. I'm here now. <br>&mdash; Then stay. Stay for tomorrow, have Christmas dinner with us. <br>&mdash; I can't. <br>&mdash; Well, then. <br>&mdash; Tomorrow's dinner is cancelled, as my sister refuses to attend. <br>&mdash; Isabella... Instead... <br>&mdash; ..we'll have it tonight. <br>&mdash; Three! Two! One! Pull! <br>&mdash; How did you do that? Your card, I believe. <br>&mdash; No! <br>&mdash; Oh, shut up! <br>&mdash; Er, Merry Christmas. <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas. <br>&mdash; Best Christmas Eve ever. <br>&mdash; Ah! Till the next one. I look forward to it. <br>&mdash; Now I'd like to say good night to Kazran. Of course. <br>&mdash; Well, on you go. <br>&mdash; Oh! Oh, yes, right! <br>&mdash; Sorry, I'll, um, I'll go, then. <br>&mdash; Good night. Good luck...night! <br>&mdash; Good night! <br>&mdash; Sorry. <br>&mdash; (Doctor!) <br>&mdash; I, er, I think she's going to kiss me. <br>&mdash; Yeah, I think you're right. <br>&mdash; I've never kissed anyone before. <br>&mdash; What do I do? Well...try and be all nervous and rubbish and a bit shaky. <br>&mdash; Why? You'll be like that anyway. Make it part of the plan. <br>&mdash; Off you go, then! <br>&mdash; What, now? I kiss her now? <br>&mdash; Kazran, it's this or go to your room and design a new kind of screwdriver. <br>&mdash; Don't make my mistakes. Now, go! <br>&mdash; Abigail! Are you coming back? <br>&mdash; The Doctor is going to do a duet with Frank. <br>&mdash; Abigail. <br>&mdash; What's wrong? <br>&mdash; I have something to tell you. <br>&mdash; A bad thing? <br>&mdash; A very bad thing. <br>&mdash; What is it? <br>&mdash; The truth. <br>&mdash; Guys, we've really got to go quite quickly. <br>&mdash; I just accidentally got engaged to Marilyn Monroe. <br>&mdash; How do you keep going like that? <br>&mdash; Do you breathe out your ears? <br>&mdash; Hello? Sorry, hello? <br>&mdash; Guys, she's phoned a chapel, there's a car outside, this is happening now! <br>&mdash; Yoo-hoo! <br>&mdash; Yoo-hoo. <br>&mdash; Right, fine, thank you. <br>&mdash; I'll just go and get married then, shall I? See how you like that! <br>&mdash; Marilyn, get your coat! <br>&mdash; What are we going to do? <br>&mdash; There is nothing to be done. <br>&mdash; Good night, Abigail. <br>&mdash; Good night, Kazran. <br>&mdash; There we go. Another day, another Christmas Eve. <br>&mdash; I'll see you in a minute, eh? I mean, a year. Doctor... <br>&mdash; Listen, why don't we leave it? <br>&mdash; Sorry, leave what? <br>&mdash; Oh, you know. This. <br>&mdash; Every Christmas Eve, it's getting a bit old. <br>&mdash; Old? <br>&mdash; Well, Christmas is for kids, isn't it? <br>&mdash; I've got some work with my dad now, I'm going to focus on that. <br>&mdash; Get that cloud belt under control. <br>&mdash; Sorry. I didn't realise I was boring you. <br>&mdash; Not your fault. Times change. <br>&mdash; Not as much as I'd hoped. <br>&mdash; Kazran. <br>&mdash; I'll be needing a new one, anyway. <br>&mdash; What the hell... <br>&mdash; Merry Christmas. <br>&mdash; And if you ever need me, just activate it. I'll hear you. <br>&mdash; I won't need you. <br>&mdash; What's happened? What are you not telling me? <br>&mdash; What about Abigail? <br>&mdash; I know where to find her. <br>&mdash; Another Christmas Eve, Kazran. <br>&mdash; But a very special one. <br>&mdash; It's complete. Look at it. <br>&mdash; Sound waves. As simple as that. <br>&mdash; We can control the clouds, the fog, the fish... <br>&mdash; Why do we want to control the fish? <br>&mdash; People are cattle. If you want to control cattle, <br>&mdash; you need to control their predators. <br>&mdash; What's the face for? <br>&mdash; Look what I'm giving you. <br>&mdash; The sky, <br>&mdash; and everything beneath it. <br>&mdash; Only you and I can control this. <br>&mdash; This planet is ours! <br>&mdash; Excuse me, Father. <br>&mdash; Yes, what? <br>&mdash; Oh, Mr President, we've been through this! <br>&mdash; It's not going to crash on my house, so what's it got to do with me? <br>&mdash; Yes, I know. 4,003. <br>&mdash; As a very old friend of mine once took a very long time to explain, <br>&mdash; life isn't fair. <br>&mdash; Hello! Who are you? What are you doing here? <br>&mdash; Didn't think this was over, did you? I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present. <br>&mdash; A ghost? Dressed like that? <br>&mdash; Eyes off the skirt. <br>&mdash; You turned into a Roman. Yeah. I do that. I also do this. <br>&mdash; Do what? What are you talking about? <br>&mdash; # Silent night <br>&mdash; # Holy night <br>&mdash; # All is calm <br>&mdash; # All is bright <br>&mdash; # Round yon virgin mother and child <br>&mdash; # Holy infant so tender and mild <br>&mdash; # Christ the Saviour is bo-orn <br>&mdash; # Christ the Saviour is born. # <br>&mdash; They're holograms. Projections, like me. Who are they? <br>&mdash; The people on the ship up there. <br>&mdash; The ones you're going to let die tonight. <br>&mdash; Why are they singing? <br>&mdash; For their lives. <br>&mdash; Which one's Abigail? <br>&mdash; The Doctor told me. Did he now? <br>&mdash; He doesn't hold back. You know the Doctor. How do I? <br>&mdash; I never met him before tonight. <br>&mdash; Now I seem to have known him all my life. How? Why? <br>&mdash; You're the only person who can let that ship land. <br>&mdash; He was trying to turn you into a nicer person. <br>&mdash; And he was trying to do it nicely. <br>&mdash; He's changed my past. My whole life! <br>&mdash; Time can be rewritten. <br>&mdash; You tell the Doctor, tell him from me, people can't. <br>&mdash; That's Abigail? I would never have known her <br>&mdash; if the Doctor hadn't changed the course of my whole life to suit himself. <br>&mdash; Well, that's good. Isn't it? No. <br>&mdash; Why is she still in there? You could let her out any time. Oh, yes. <br>&mdash; Any time at all. Any time... <br>&mdash; I choose. Then why don't you? <br>&mdash; This is what the Doctor did to me. <br>&mdash; Abigail was ill when she went into the ice. <br>&mdash; On the point of death. <br>&mdash; I suppose the rest in the ice helped her, <br>&mdash; but she's used up her time. <br>&mdash; All those Christmas Eves with me. <br>&mdash; I could release her any time I want... <br>&mdash; ..and she would live a single day. <br>&mdash; So tell me, Ghost of Christmas Present, <br>&mdash; how do I choose which day? <br>&mdash; I'm sorry. I really am. <br>&mdash; I'm very, very sorry. <br>&mdash; But you know what? She's got more time left than I have. <br>&mdash; More than anyone on this ship. Good. <br>&mdash; Rory, widen the beam. <br>&mdash; Update on engine one... <br>&mdash; How did I get here? <br>&mdash; You didn't. It's your turn to be the hologram. <br>&mdash; Since you're going to let a lot of people die, <br>&mdash; I thought you might like to see where it happens. <br>&mdash; The singing... <br>&mdash; What is it? I don't understand. <br>&mdash; The Doctor's idea. <br>&mdash; The harmonies resonate in the ice crystals. The fish like it. <br>&mdash; He thought maybe it would stabilise the ship. <br>&mdash; But it isn't working. It's not powerful enough. <br>&mdash; Why are they still singing, then? We haven't told them. <br>&mdash; I understand you have a machine that controls this cloud layer. <br>&mdash; If you can release us from it, we still have time to make a landing. <br>&mdash; Nobody has to die. Everybody has to die. <br>&mdash; Not tonight. Tonight's as good as any other. <br>&mdash; How do you choose? <br>&mdash; Doctor? "Yeah?" Are you hearing this? <br>&mdash; "I can hear." He's here? <br>&mdash; Where is he? Doctor?! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; I'm sorry. I didn't realise. <br>&mdash; All my life, I've been called heartless. <br>&mdash; My other life, my real life, the one you rewrote. <br>&mdash; Now look at me. <br>&mdash; Better a broken heart than no heart at all. <br>&mdash; Oh, try it. You try it. <br>&mdash; Why are you here? Cos I'm not finished with you yet. <br>&mdash; You've seen the past, the present... <br>&mdash; ..and now you need to see the future. <br>&mdash; Fine! Do it! Show me! I'll die cold, alone and afraid. <br>&mdash; Of course I will, we all do! What difference does showing me make? <br>&mdash; Do you know why I'm going to let those people die? <br>&mdash; It's not a plan. I don't get anything from it. <br>&mdash; It's just that I don't care. <br>&mdash; I'm not like you. I don't even want to be like you! <br>&mdash; I don't and never, ever will care! <br>&mdash; And I don't believe that. <br>&mdash; Then show me the future. <br>&mdash; Prove me wrong. I am showing it to you. I'm showing it to you right now. <br>&mdash; So what do you think? <br>&mdash; Is this who you want to become, Kazran? <br>&mdash; Dad? <br>&mdash; This planet is ours. <br>&mdash; I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. <br>&mdash; It's OK, don't be frightened. <br>&mdash; I'm...I'm so, so, so... <br>&mdash; Kazran. <br>&mdash; We don't have much time. <br>&mdash; Structural integrity at 30%! We have five minutes max. <br>&mdash; We need to land! <br>&mdash; "Hello, hello! Ah, hello, everyone. Prepare to lock on to my signal." <br>&mdash; Doctor, what's happening? "I saved Christmas. Don't go away." <br>&mdash; Doctor? Doctor! <br>&mdash; We good to go, then? The controls won't respond. <br>&mdash; They're isomorphic, tuned to your brainwaves, <br>&mdash; they'll only respond to you. They won't. <br>&mdash; That doesn't make sense, why wouldn't... <br>&mdash; Oh! Oh, of course. <br>&mdash; Stupid, stupid Doctor! <br>&mdash; What's wrong? Tell me, what is it, what...? It's you. <br>&mdash; I've changed you too much, the machine doesn't recognise you. <br>&mdash; But my father programmed it... <br>&mdash; He would never have programmed it for the man you are now. <br>&mdash; Then what do we do? Um... <br>&mdash; Um... I don't know, I don't know. There must be something! <br>&mdash; This! You can use this! I kept it, see? What, half a screwdriver? <br>&mdash; With the other half up in the sky in a big old shark, <br>&mdash; right in the heart of the cloud layer. <br>&mdash; We use your aerial to boost the signal, <br>&mdash; set up a resonation pattern between the two halves...That would work! <br>&mdash; My screwdriver, coolest bit of kit on this planet. Could do it. <br>&mdash; Do what? My screwdriver is still trying to repair. <br>&mdash; It's signalling itself. <br>&mdash; We use the signal, but we send something else. <br>&mdash; Send what? <br>&mdash; Well? What? What? <br>&mdash; I'm sorry, Kazran. I truly am. <br>&mdash; I don't understand. <br>&mdash; We need to send something into the cloud belt, something we know works. <br>&mdash; We need her to sing. <br>&mdash; Her voice resonates perfectly with the ice crystals. <br>&mdash; It calmed the shark. It will calm the sky, too. <br>&mdash; Could you do it? <br>&mdash; Could you do this? <br>&mdash; Think about it, Doctor. <br>&mdash; One last day with your beloved. <br>&mdash; Which day would you choose? <br>&mdash; Christmas. Christmas Day. <br>&mdash; Look at you. So old now. <br>&mdash; I think you waited a bit too long, didn't you? I'm sorry. <br>&mdash; Hoarding my days, like an old miser. <br>&mdash; But...if you leave the ice now... <br>&mdash; We've had so many Christmas Eves, Kazran. <br>&mdash; I think it's time for Christmas Day. <br>&mdash; Doctor?! We can't hold this. Time's up, we're going down. Doctor! <br>&mdash; Captain, I've got... <br>&mdash; I don't know what I've got. <br>&mdash; What are you listening to? <br>&mdash; This is coming from outside. <br>&mdash; This is coming from the clouds. <br>&mdash; Well? Well, the singing resonates in the crystals. <br>&mdash; It's feeding back and forth between the two halves of the screwdriver. <br>&mdash; One song, filling the sky. <br>&mdash; The crystals will align, I'll feed in a controlled phase loop, <br>&mdash; and the clouds will unlock. What does that mean? <br>&mdash; What happens when a cloud unlocks? <br>&mdash; Something that hasn't happened in this town for a very long time now. <br>&mdash; # When you're alone <br>&mdash; # Silence is all you see <br>&mdash; # When you're alone <br>&mdash; # Silence is all you'll be... # <br>&mdash; We're flying normally. Can you land? <br>&mdash; I can even land well. <br>&mdash; Oh, he did it. The Doctor did it. <br>&mdash; Yeah, he gets all the credit. <br>&mdash; Which is actually fair enough, if you think about it. <br>&mdash; # When you are here <br>&mdash; # Music is all around <br>&mdash; # When you are near <br>&mdash; # Music is all around <br>&mdash; # Open your eyes <br>&mdash; # Don't make a sound... # <br>&mdash; Hello, my old friend. <br>&mdash; # Let in the shadow... # <br>&mdash; Let's go. <br>&mdash; # Let in the shadow <br>&mdash; # Let in the light <br>&mdash; # Of your bright shadow <br>&mdash; # Let in the shadow <br>&mdash; # Let in the shadow <br>&mdash; # Let in the light <br>&mdash; # Of your bright shadow... # <br>&mdash; You know, that could almost be mistaken for a real person. <br>&mdash; The snowman isn't bad, either. Ah, yes, you two! About time! <br>&mdash; Why are you dressed like that? Ah, kind of lost our luggage. <br>&mdash; Kind of crash landed. Yeah, but why are you dressed like that at all? <br>&mdash; They really love their snowmen around here. <br>&mdash; I've counted about 20. Yeah, I've been busy. <br>&mdash; Yeah, yeah, you have. <br>&mdash; Thank you. Pleasure. Right, come on, then, let's go! <br>&mdash; Got any more honeymoon ideas? <br>&mdash; There's a moon that's made of actual honey. Well, not actual honey. <br>&mdash; And it's not actually a moon. <br>&mdash; And technically, it's alive and a bit carnivorous, <br>&mdash; but there are some lovely views. <br>&mdash; Yeah, great, thanks(!) <br>&mdash; Are you OK? Course I'm OK. You? <br>&mdash; Of course. <br>&mdash; It'll be their last day together, won't it? <br>&mdash; Everything has to end some time, <br>&mdash; otherwise nothing would ever get started. <br>&mdash; Your phone was ringing. <br>&mdash; Someone called Marilyn. <br>&mdash; Actually sounds like THE Marilyn. <br>&mdash; Doctor? Tell her I'll phone her back. <br>&mdash; And that was never a real chapel. <br>&mdash; Where are they? Kazran and Abigail. <br>&mdash; Off on a little trip, I should think. Where? Christmas. <br>&mdash; Christmas? Yeah, Christmas. <br>&mdash; Halfway out of the dark. <br>&mdash; Where's the Doctor? <br>&mdash; I've been running... <br>&mdash; faster than I've ever run. Now it's time for me to stop. <br>&mdash; I'm going to need a SWAT team ready to mobilise, street-level maps <br>&mdash; covering all of Florida, a pot of coffee, 12 Jammy Dodgers and a Fez. <br>&mdash; Somewhere different, somewhere brand new. <br>&mdash; I wear a Stetson now. <br>&mdash; Stetsons are cool. <br>&mdash; We've been recruited. Recruited by who? <br>&mdash; You have to trust US this time. <br>&mdash; You have to do this and you can't ask why. <br>&mdash; My life in your hands. <br>&mdash; Amelia Pond. <br>&mdash; You see these eyes? They're old eyes. <br>&mdash; And one thing I can tell you... <br>&mdash; ..monsters are real. <br></div></body></html>
