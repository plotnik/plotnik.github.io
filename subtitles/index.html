      <h3>Doctor Who - 6x02 - Day of the Moon (2)</h3>
      
    &mdash; Space, 1969. <br>&mdash; No! <br>&mdash; The Doctor we saw on the beach is a future version, <br>&mdash; 200 years older than the one up there. <br>&mdash; Canton Everett Delaware the third. Who's he? <br>&mdash; What the hell is that? <br>&mdash; Mr President. <br>&mdash; You didn't have to kill her, she couldn't even remember you! <br>&mdash; How does that work? We can only remember you while we're seeing you, is that it? <br>&mdash; SHE GASPS <br>&mdash; Canton! Are you OK? Doctor. <br>&mdash; I'm pregnant. <br>&mdash; No! <br>&mdash; Just think directly ahead. <br>&mdash; Coming to you now. Over. <br>&mdash; Canton. Miss Pond. <br>&mdash; Is that a body bag? Yes, it is. <br>&mdash; It's empty. How about that. <br>&mdash; Do you even know why you're doing this, eh? Can you even remember? <br>&mdash; The Warehouse? Amy! Amy! <br>&mdash; What the hell's going on? Look behind you. <br>&mdash; There's nothing behind me! Look! Canton, look! <br>&mdash; GUNSHOT <br>&mdash; PA: 'All visitors to remain behind the yellow line. <br>&mdash; 'All visitors to remain behind the yellow line.' <br>&mdash; We found Amy Pond. <br>&mdash; She had strange markings on her arm. <br>&mdash; Do you know what they are? <br>&mdash; Why don't you ask her? <br>&mdash; METALLIC CLATTER <br>&mdash; I see you! <br>&mdash; I see you! <br>&mdash; Doctor Song. <br>&mdash; Doctor Song? <br>&mdash; Go, go, go! <br>&mdash; Don't move! <br>&mdash; It's over! They're here, Canton. <br>&mdash; They're everywhere. I know. <br>&mdash; America's being invaded. <br>&mdash; You were invaded a long time ago. <br>&mdash; America is occupied. <br>&mdash; You're coming with us, Dr Song. <br>&mdash; There's no way out, this time. <br>&mdash; There's always a way out. <br>&mdash; We found Dr Song. <br>&mdash; These bricks, what are they made of? <br>&mdash; Where is she? She ran. <br>&mdash; Off the 50th floor. <br>&mdash; I'd say zero balanced dwarf star alloy. <br>&mdash; The densest material in the universe. Nothing gets through that. <br>&mdash; You're building me the perfect prison. <br>&mdash; And it still won't be enough. <br>&mdash; What are you waiting for? I'm waiting for you to run. <br>&mdash; It'll look better if I shot you while you were running. <br>&mdash; Then again, looks aren't everything. <br>&mdash; GUNSHOT <br>&mdash; Is there a reason you're doing this? <br>&mdash; I want you to know where you stand. <br>&mdash; In a cell. In the perfect cell. <br>&mdash; Nothing can penetrate these walls. <br>&mdash; Not a sound, not a radio wave. <br>&mdash; Not the tiniest particle of anything. <br>&mdash; In here, you are literally cut off from the rest of the universe. <br>&mdash; So I guess they can't hear us, right? <br>&mdash; Good work, Canton. Door sealed? You bet. <br>&mdash; You OK? Finally <br>&mdash; These things could really do with air holes. <br>&mdash; Never had a complaint before. <br>&mdash; Isn't it going to look odd that you're staying in here with us? <br>&mdash; Odd, but not alarming. They know there's no way out of this place. <br>&mdash; Exactly. Whatever they might think we're doing in here, they know we're not going anywhere. <br>&mdash; Shall we? <br>&mdash; What about Dr Song? <br>&mdash; She dove off a rooftop! <br>&mdash; Don't worry. She does that. <br>&mdash; Amy, Rory, open all the doors to the swimming pool. <br>&mdash; So, we know they're everywhere. Not just a landing party, an occupying force. <br>&mdash; And they've been here a very, very long time. But nobody knows that, cos no one can remember them. <br>&mdash; So what are they up to? <br>&mdash; No idea. But the good news is... we've got a secret weapon. <br>&mdash; Apollo 11's your secret weapon? <br>&mdash; No, no, it's not Apollo 11, that would be silly. <br>&mdash; It's Neil Armstrong's foot. <br>&mdash; RADIO: 'In just a few days mankind will set foot on the moon <br>&mdash; 'for the first time. <br>&mdash; 'Today the President reaffirmed America's commitment...' <br>&mdash; Ready. Check? <br>&mdash; Clear. Clear. <br>&mdash; Ow! So, three months. what have we found out? <br>&mdash; Well, they are everywhere. <br>&mdash; Every state in America. Ow! Not just America, the entire world. <br>&mdash; There's a greater concentration here though. <br>&mdash; Ow! <br>&mdash; You OK? <br>&mdash; All better. Better? <br>&mdash; Turns out I was wrong. I'm not pregnant. <br>&mdash; What's up? Nothing. <br>&mdash; Really, nothing, seriously. <br>&mdash; So you've seen them, but you don't remember them. <br>&mdash; You've seen them too. That night at the warehouse, remember? <br>&mdash; While you were pretending to hunt us down <br>&mdash; we saw hundreds of those things. <br>&mdash; We still don't know what they look like. <br>&mdash; It's like they edit themselves out of your memory <br>&mdash; as soon as you look away. <br>&mdash; The exact second you're not looking at them, you can't remember anything. <br>&mdash; Sometimes you feel a bit sick though, but not always. So that's why you marked your skin? <br>&mdash; Only way we'd know if we'd had an encounter. <br>&mdash; How long have they been here? That's what we've spent three months trying to find out. <br>&mdash; Not easy, if you can't remember anything you discover. But how long do you think? <br>&mdash; As long as there's been something in the corner of your eye, <br>&mdash; or creaking in your house, or breathing under your bed, or voices through a wall. <br>&mdash; They've been running your lives for a very long time now, so keep this straight in your head. <br>&mdash; We are not fighting an alien invasion. <br>&mdash; We're leading a revolution. <br>&mdash; And today the battle begins. How? <br>&mdash; Like this. <br>&mdash; Ow! Ha-ha! <br>&mdash; Nano recorder. Fuses with the cartilage in your hand. <br>&mdash; Ow! Then it tunes itself directly to the speech centres in your brain. <br>&mdash; It'll pick up your voice, no matter what. Telepathic connection. <br>&mdash; So the moment you see one of the creatures, you activate it. <br>&mdash; And describe aloud exactly what you're seeing. <br>&mdash; RECORDER: 'And describe aloud exactly what you're seeing.' <br>&mdash; Because the moment you break contact, you're going to forget it happened. <br>&mdash; The light will flash if you've left yourself a message. <br>&mdash; You keep checking your hand. <br>&mdash; If you've had an encounter that's the first you'll know about it. <br>&mdash; Why didn't you tell me this before we started? I did. <br>&mdash; But even information about these creatures erases itself over time. <br>&mdash; I couldn't refresh it, cos I couldn't talk to you. <br>&mdash; What? <br>&mdash; What are you staring at? Look at your hand. <br>&mdash; Why's it doing that? What does it mean if the light's flashing? <br>&mdash; What did I just tell you?  I haven't... Play it. <br>&mdash; 'My God, how did it get in here?' <br>&mdash; 'Keep eye contact with the creature and when I say, <br>&mdash; 'turn back, and when you do, straighten my bow tie.' <br>&mdash; 'What? What are you staring at?' <br>&mdash; 'Look at your hand.' <br>&mdash; It's a hologram, extrapolated from a photo on Amy's phone. <br>&mdash; Take a good long look. <br>&mdash; You just saw an image of one of the creatures we're fighting. <br>&mdash; Describe it to me. <br>&mdash; I can't. No. <br>&mdash; Neither can I. <br>&mdash; You straightened my bow tie because I planted the idea <br>&mdash; in your head while you were looking at the creature. <br>&mdash; So they could do that to people. You could be doing stuff and not really knowing why you're doing it. <br>&mdash; Like post hypnotic suggestion. <br>&mdash; Ruling the world with post hypnotic suggestion. Now then, a little girl in a space suit. <br>&mdash; They got the suit from NASA, but where did they get the girl?. Could be anywhere. <br>&mdash; Except they probably stayed close to that warehouse, cos why bother doing anything else? <br>&mdash; And they take her from somewhere to cause the least amount of attention. <br>&mdash; But you'll have to find her. I'm off to NASA. Find her? <br>&mdash; Where do we look? Children's homes. <br>&mdash; KNOCK ON DOOR <br>&mdash; Hello. FBI. You must be Dr Renfrew. Can we come in? <br>&mdash; The children are asleep. We'll be very quiet. <br>&mdash; Is there a problem? <br>&mdash; It's about a missing child. <br>&mdash; What are you...? <br>&mdash; Yes, yes, come in, please. <br>&mdash; This way. <br>&mdash; Please excuse the writing. <br>&mdash; It keeps happening. <br>&mdash; I try to clean it up. <br>&mdash; It's the kids, yeah? They do that? <br>&mdash; Yes. The children. It must be, yes. <br>&mdash; Anyway, my office is this way. <br>&mdash; We nearly didn't come to this place. <br>&mdash; I understood Graystark Hall was closed in '67. <br>&mdash; That's the plan, yes. <br>&mdash; The plan? <br>&mdash; Not long now. <br>&mdash; It's 1969. No, no. We close in '67. That's the plan, yes. <br>&mdash; You misunderstood me, sir. <br>&mdash; It's 1969 now. <br>&mdash; Why are you saying that? <br>&mdash; Of course, it isn't. July. <br>&mdash; My office is this way, this way. <br>&mdash; I'll check upstairs. Be careful. <br>&mdash; MOBILE BLEEPS <br>&mdash; Amy? I think we've found the place she was taken from. How do you know? <br>&mdash; Cos those things have been here. But the whole place is deserted. <br>&mdash; There's just one guy here and I think he's lost it. <br>&mdash; Repeated memory wipes fry your head eventually. <br>&mdash; Find out what you can, but don't hang around. Where are you? <br>&mdash; Gotta go! Got company! <br>&mdash; Don't worry. I put everything back the way I found out. <br>&mdash; Except this. <br>&mdash; there's always a bit left over, isn't there? <br>&mdash; STEADY BLEEPING <br>&mdash; 'I can see them, but I think they're asleep. Get out! Just get out!' <br>&mdash; BIN CLATTERS <br>&mdash; HISSING <br>&mdash; One more time, sir. How the hell did you get into the command module? <br>&mdash; I told you! I'm on a top secret mission for the President. <br>&mdash; Well, maybe if you just get President Nixon to assure us of that, sir, <br>&mdash; that would be swell. <br>&mdash; I sent him a message. <br>&mdash; Hello, I believe it's Mr Gardner, is that correct? Head of security? <br>&mdash; Ah, yes, sir. Yes, Mr President. <br>&mdash; Mr Grant, is it? Yes, Mr President. <br>&mdash; The hopes and dreams of millions of Americans stand here today, <br>&mdash; at Cape Kennedy, and you are the men who guard those dreams. <br>&mdash; On behalf of the American people, I thank you. <br>&mdash; You're welcome, Mr President. I understand you have a baby on the way, Mr Grant? <br>&mdash; Yes, Mr President. What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl? <br>&mdash; Just a healthy American, sir. <br>&mdash; A healthy American will do just nicely. <br>&mdash; Now, fellas, listen. This man here. <br>&mdash; Code name, The Doctor, is doing some work for me, personally. <br>&mdash; Could you cut him a little slack? <br>&mdash; Er, Mr President, he did break into Apollo 11. <br>&mdash; Well, I'm sure he had a very good reason for that. <br>&mdash; But I need you to release him now, so he can get on <br>&mdash; with some very important work for the American people. <br>&mdash; Could you do that for me? Well... <br>&mdash; Son, I am your Commander in Chief. <br>&mdash; Then I guess that would be fine, Mr President. <br>&mdash; Glad to hear it. <br>&mdash; Thank you! <br>&mdash; Bye-bye. <br>&mdash; Carry on, gentlemen. <br>&mdash; America salutes you. <br>&mdash; This place, it's been closed for years. <br>&mdash; What have you been doing? <br>&mdash; Oh, the child, <br>&mdash; she must be cared for. <br>&mdash; It's important. <br>&mdash; That's what they said. <br>&mdash; That's what who said? <br>&mdash; CLINK! <br>&mdash; Hello. Who are you? <br>&mdash; No, I think she's just dreaming. <br>&mdash; Hello? I saw you, looking through the hatch... <br>&mdash; How? <br>&mdash; How can that be me? <br>&mdash; Who are you? I don't understand, so just tell me who you are! <br>&mdash; I'm sorry. <br>&mdash; I didn't mean to shoot you. <br>&mdash; I'm glad I missed. <br>&mdash; But you killed The Doctor. <br>&mdash; You're going to kill him. <br>&mdash; But who are you? <br>&mdash; Just please tell me, because I don't understand! <br>&mdash; Please help me. <br>&mdash; Help me, please. <br>&mdash; Aaaargh! <br>&mdash; THUMPING <br>&mdash; It's just some questions. <br>&mdash; Yes, I see. <br>&mdash; Who was that? Doctor Renfrew? <br>&mdash; Who was that? <br>&mdash; Who was who? <br>&mdash; What are you? You can tell me. <br>&mdash; Cos I won't remember. <br>&mdash; You invaded us. You're everywhere. <br>&mdash; AMY: Help me! Canton, please will you help me?! <br>&mdash; Are you armed? This world is ours. <br>&mdash; We have ruled it since the wheel and the fire. <br>&mdash; We have no need of weapons. Yeah? <br>&mdash; Welcome to America. <br>&mdash; Amy! <br>&mdash; You have to tape everything that happens in this office, every word. <br>&mdash; or we won't know if you're under the influence. Doctor, you have to give me more than this. <br>&mdash; What were you doing to Apollo 11? <br>&mdash; A thing. A clever thing. No more questions. <br>&mdash; You have to trust me and nobody else. <br>&mdash; Doctor! It's Canton! <br>&mdash; Quick, he needs us! <br>&mdash; AMY: 'Help me!' <br>&mdash; 'Please, I can't, I can't see! Somebody help me!' Amy! <br>&mdash; Amy, can you hear me? <br>&mdash; Amy, I'm going to try to blow the lock. I need you to stand back. <br>&mdash; OK, gun down, I've got it! Amy, we're here. Are you OK? <br>&mdash; AMY: 'I can't see!' <br>&mdash; Where is she, Doctor? <br>&mdash; It's empty. AMY: 'It's dark, it's so dark. <br>&mdash; 'I don't know where I am. <br>&mdash; 'Please, can anybody hear me?' <br>&mdash; They took this out of her? <br>&mdash; How did they do that, Doctor? <br>&mdash; SOBBING <br>&mdash; Why can I still hear her? <br>&mdash; Is it a recording? <br>&mdash; It defaults to live. This is current. <br>&mdash; Wherever she is right now, this is what she's saying. <br>&mdash; Amy, can you hear me? We're coming for you. <br>&mdash; Wherever you are, we're coming, I swear. <br>&mdash; She can't hear you. <br>&mdash; I'm so sorry. It's one way. <br>&mdash; She can always hear me, Doctor. <br>&mdash; Always, wherever she is. <br>&mdash; She always knows that I am coming for her, do you understand me? <br>&mdash; Always. <br>&mdash; AMY: 'Doctor, are you out there? <br>&mdash; 'Can you hear me? Doctor? <br>&mdash; 'Oh, God. <br>&mdash; 'Please, please, Doctor, just get me out of this.' <br>&mdash; He's coming. I'll bring him, I swear. <br>&mdash; Hello, is someone in there? Who? <br>&mdash; I think someone has been shot. <br>&mdash; I think we should help. We... <br>&mdash; I can't... I can't remember. <br>&mdash; OK. <br>&mdash; Who and what are you? <br>&mdash; Silence, Doctor. <br>&mdash; We are the Silence. <br>&mdash; Silence, Doctor. <br>&mdash; Rory listen to that. Silence? We ran from the Silence? Silence. <br>&mdash; And silence will fall. <br>&mdash; Hello again. Sir, you've been in there for days. <br>&mdash; What the hell have you been doing? Doesn't matter. <br>&mdash; I need Dr Shepherd here right now. <br>&mdash; Sir, I need to talk to Colonel Jefferson right now! <br>&mdash; No, you really don't. <br>&mdash; Hi, fellas. <br>&mdash; I'm President Nixon. <br>&mdash; I want to tell you, on behalf of the American people, how much we appreciate all of your hard work. <br>&mdash; The target for the Apollo 11 astronauts, <br>&mdash; the moon, at lift off, will be at a distance of 218,096 miles away. <br>&mdash; We're just past the two minute mark on the countdown. <br>&mdash; T minus one minute 54 seconds and counting... <br>&mdash; It's an exo skeleton. Basically, life support. <br>&mdash; There's about 20 different kinds of alien tech in here. <br>&mdash; Who was she? Why put her in here? <br>&mdash; Put this on, you don't even need to eat. <br>&mdash; The suit processes sunlight directly. <br>&mdash; It's got built in weaponry and a communications system that can hack into anything. <br>&mdash; Including the telephone network? <br>&mdash; Easily. Why phone the President? <br>&mdash; It defaults to the highest authority it can find. <br>&mdash; The little girl gets frightened, the most powerful man on Earth gets a phone call. <br>&mdash; The night terrors with a hotline to the White House. <br>&mdash; You won't learn anything from that envelope, you know. <br>&mdash; Purchased on Earth, perfectly ordinary stationery, TARDIS blue. <br>&mdash; Summoned by a stranger who won't even show his face. <br>&mdash; That's a first for me. How about you? <br>&mdash; Our lives are back to front. <br>&mdash; Your future's my past, your firsts are my lasts. <br>&mdash; Not really what I asked. Ask something else then. <br>&mdash; What are the Silence doing? Raising a child? Keeping her safe. Even giving her independence. <br>&mdash; The only way to save Amy is to work out what the Silence are doing. <br>&mdash; I know. Every single thing we learn about them brings us a step closer. <br>&mdash; Yeah, Doctor, I get it, I know. <br>&mdash; Of course, it's possible she's not just any little girl. <br>&mdash; Well, I'd say she's human, going by the life support software. <br>&mdash; But? She climbed out of this suit. <br>&mdash; Like she forced her way out. She must be incredibly strong. <br>&mdash; Incredibly strong and running away. I like her. <br>&mdash; We should be trying to find her. <br>&mdash; Yes, I know, but how? <br>&mdash; Anyway, I have the strangest feeling she's going to find us. <br>&mdash; 'This is Houston, do you read? Over.' <br>&mdash; Why does it look like a NASA space suit? <br>&mdash; Because that's what the Silence do. Think about it. <br>&mdash; They don't make anything themselves. <br>&mdash; They don't have to. They get other life forms to do it for them. <br>&mdash; So they're parasites then? Super parasites. <br>&mdash; Standing in the shadows of human history since the very beginning. <br>&mdash; We know they can influence human behaviour any way they want. <br>&mdash; If they've been doing that on a global scale for thousands of years... <br>&mdash; Then what? <br>&mdash; Then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the moon? <br>&mdash; 'Ten, nine, ignition sequence start, six, five, four...' <br>&mdash; Because the Silence needed a space suit. <br>&mdash; '..one, zero, all engines on. <br>&mdash; 'Lift off. We have a lift off. <br>&mdash; '32 minutes past the hour, lift off on Apollo 11.' <br>&mdash; My God! What is it? <br>&mdash; It's just an alien, Dr Shepherd. <br>&mdash; Someone's already been treating it. Yeah. <br>&mdash; You've been treating it. <br>&mdash; Does Colonel Jefferson know this thing is here? No. <br>&mdash; Then I'm going to tell him right now! <br>&mdash; Again? Sorry, what? Exactly. <br>&mdash; Sergeant, why was I called in here for no reason? <br>&mdash; You tend to my wounds. <br>&mdash; You are foolish. <br>&mdash; Why? What you do in my place? <br>&mdash; We have ruled your lives since your lives began. <br>&mdash; You should kill us all on sight, <br>&mdash; but you will never remember we were even here. <br>&mdash; Your will is ours. <br>&mdash; Well, sorry to disappoint you, <br>&mdash; but thanks. <br>&mdash; It's exactly what I needed to hear. <br>&mdash; This is a video phone. <br>&mdash; Whatever a video phone is. <br>&mdash; You should kill us all on sight. <br>&mdash; SOBBING <br>&mdash; This suit, it seems to be repairing itself. How is it doing that? <br>&mdash; Doctor, a unit like this, would it ever be able to move without an occupant? Why? <br>&mdash; Well, the little girl said the space man was coming to eat her. <br>&mdash; Maybe that's exactly what happened. <br>&mdash; AMY: 'I love you. I know you think it's him. <br>&mdash; 'I know you think it ought to be him. But it's not, it's you. <br>&mdash; 'And when I see you again. <br>&mdash; 'I'm going tell you properly, just to see your stupid face. <br>&mdash; 'My life was so boring before you just dropped out of the sky. <br>&mdash; 'So just get your stupid face where I can see it. <br>&mdash; 'OK? <br>&mdash; 'OK?' <br>&mdash; She'll be safe for now. <br>&mdash; No point in a dead hostage. <br>&mdash; Can't you save her? <br>&mdash; I can track that signal back. Take us right to her. <br>&mdash; Then why haven't you? Because then what? <br>&mdash; I find her, and then what do I do? <br>&mdash; This isn't an alien invasion. They live here. <br>&mdash; This is their empire. <br>&mdash; This is kicking the Romans out of Rome. Rome fell. <br>&mdash; I know. <br>&mdash; I was there. <br>&mdash; So was I. <br>&mdash; Personal question. <br>&mdash; Seriously? You? <br>&mdash; Do you ever remember it? <br>&mdash; 2,000 years, waiting for Amy? <br>&mdash; The Last Centurion? <br>&mdash; No. Are you lying? <br>&mdash; Course I'm lying. Course you are. <br>&mdash; Not the sort of thing anyone forgets. <br>&mdash; But I don't remember it all the time. <br>&mdash; It's like there's... <br>&mdash; a door in my head. <br>&mdash; I can keep it shut. AMY: 'Please come and get me. <br>&mdash; 'Come and get me.' AMY SOBS <br>&mdash; Just five days since Apollo 11 blasted off from Cape Kennedy, <br>&mdash; this unprecedented journey is reaching its crucial moment. <br>&mdash; Armstrong and Aldrin are making their descent to the surface of the moon. <br>&mdash; On the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. <br>&mdash; Where am I? Where is this? <br>&mdash; You are Amelia Pond. <br>&mdash; You're ugly, has anyone mentioned that to you? <br>&mdash; We do you honour. <br>&mdash; You will bring the Silence. <br>&mdash; But your part will soon be over. <br>&mdash; Whatever that means, you've made a big mistake bringing me here, <br>&mdash; because wait till you see what's coming for you now. <br>&mdash; You have been here many days. <br>&mdash; No. I just got here. You just put me in here. <br>&mdash; Your memory is weak. <br>&mdash; You have been here many days. <br>&mdash; No. No, I can't have been. <br>&mdash; You will sleep now. <br>&mdash; Sleep. <br>&mdash; No! No! <br>&mdash; Get off me! Sleep. No! No! <br>&mdash; Oh! Interesting. <br>&mdash; Very Aickman Road, seen one of these before. <br>&mdash; Abandoned, wonder how that happened. <br>&mdash; Oh, well! I suppose I'm about to find out. Rory, River, keep one Silent in eyeshot at all times. <br>&mdash; Oh, hello, sorry. You're in the middle of something. <br>&mdash; Just had to say though, have you seen what's on the telly? <br>&mdash; Hello, Amy, you all right? Want to watch some television? <br>&mdash; Ah, now, stay where you are. <br>&mdash; Because look at me, I'm confident. <br>&mdash; You want to watch that, me, when I'm confident. Oh, and this is my friend, River. <br>&mdash; Nice hair, clever, has own gun, and unlike me, she really doesn't mind shooting people. <br>&mdash; I shouldn't like that. Kind of do. Thank you, sweetie. I know you're team players and everything, <br>&mdash; but she'll definitely kill at least the first three of you. <br>&mdash; The first seven, easily. Seven, really? <br>&mdash; Oh, eight for you, honey. Stop it. <br>&mdash; Make me! Yeah, well, maybe I will. Is this really important, flirting? <br>&mdash; I feel like I should be higher on the list right now. Sorry. <br>&mdash; As I was saying, my naughty friend here is going kill the first three of you to attack, plus him behind. <br>&mdash; So maybe you want to draw lots, or have a quiz. What's he got? <br>&mdash; Something, I hope. Or maybe you could just listen a minute, <br>&mdash; because all I really want to do is accept your total surrender, and then I'll let you go in peace. <br>&mdash; You've been interfering in human history for thousands of years. <br>&mdash; People have suffered and died. But what's the point in two hearts, <br>&mdash; if you can't be a bit forgiving now and then. <br>&mdash; Ooh! <br>&mdash; The Silence. <br>&mdash; You guys take that seriously, don't you? OK, you got me, I'm lying. <br>&mdash; I'm not really going to let you go that easily. Nice thought, but it's not Christmas. <br>&mdash; First, you tell me about the girl. Who is she? Why is she important? What's she for? <br>&mdash; Guys, sorry. <br>&mdash; But you're way out of time. <br>&mdash; Now, come on, a bit of history for you. <br>&mdash; Aren't you proud, because you helped? <br>&mdash; Do you know how many people are watching this live on the telly? <br>&mdash; Half a billion, and that's nothing, <br>&mdash; because the human race will spread out among the stars, you just watch them fly. <br>&mdash; Billions and billions of them, for billions and billions of years. <br>&mdash; And every single one of them, at some point in their lives, <br>&mdash; will look back at this man, taking that very first step, <br>&mdash; and they will never, ever forget it. <br>&mdash; Oh. <br>&mdash; But they'll forget this bit. <br>&mdash; Ready? Ready. <br>&mdash; It's one small step for man... <br>&mdash; You should kill us all on sight. <br>&mdash; You should kill us all on sight. <br>&mdash; You should kill us all on sight. <br>&mdash; You should kill us all on sight. <br>&mdash; You've given the order for your own execution, <br>&mdash; and the whole planet just heard you. <br>&mdash; You should kill us all on sight. <br>&mdash; ..One giant leap for mankind. <br>&mdash; And one whacking great kick up the backside for the Silence! <br>&mdash; You just raised an army against yourself. <br>&mdash; And now, for a thousand generations, <br>&mdash; you're going to be ordering them to destroy you every day. <br>&mdash; How fast can you run? <br>&mdash; Because today's the day the human race throw you off their planet. <br>&mdash; They won't even know they're doing it. <br>&mdash; I think, quite possibly the word you're looking for right now is, <br>&mdash; "Oops!" Run! Guys, I mean us! Run! <br>&mdash; I can't get her out! <br>&mdash; Go, just go! We are not leaving without you! <br>&mdash; Will you just get your stupid face out of here?! <br>&mdash; Right, into the TARDIS, quickly! <br>&mdash; Don't let them build to full power!! I know, there's a reason why I'm shooting, honey! <br>&mdash; What are you doing? <br>&mdash; Helping. You've got a screwdriver. Go build a cabinet! <br>&mdash; That's really rude! Shut up and drive! <br>&mdash; My old fella didn't see that, did he? <br>&mdash; He gets ever so cross. <br>&mdash; So, what kind of doctor are you? Archaeology. <br>&mdash; Love a tomb. <br>&mdash; You can let me fly it! <br>&mdash; Or we could go where we're supposed to. <br>&mdash; What's the matter with you? You called me stupid. <br>&mdash; I always call you stupid. <br>&mdash; No, but... <br>&mdash; my face. <br>&mdash; I wasn't sure who you were talking about. <br>&mdash; You know, me, or... Him? <br>&mdash; Well, you did say, "Dropped out of the sky." <br>&mdash; It's a figure of speech, moron! <br>&mdash; Thanks. You're welcome. <br>&mdash; So we're safe again. Safe? No, of course you're not safe. <br>&mdash; There's a billion other things out there, waiting to burn your whole world. <br>&mdash; But if you want to pretend you're safe, just so you can sleep at night, OK, you're safe. <br>&mdash; But you're not really. <br>&mdash; Canton. Till the next one, eh? <br>&mdash; Looking forward to it. Canton just wants to get married. <br>&mdash; Helluva reason to kick him out of the FBI. <br>&mdash; I'm sure something can be arranged. <br>&mdash; I'm counting on you. Er, Doctor... <br>&mdash; ..Canton here tells me you're... <br>&mdash; ..from the future. <br>&mdash; Hardly seems possible, but I was wondering... <br>&mdash; Should warn you. I don't answer a lot of questions. <br>&mdash; But I'm a President at the beginning of his time. <br>&mdash; Dare I ask? <br>&mdash; Will I be remembered? <br>&mdash; Oh, Dickie. Tricky Dickie. <br>&mdash; They're never going to forget you. <br>&mdash; Say hi to David Frost for me. David Frost? <br>&mdash; This person you want to marry. <br>&mdash; Black? <br>&mdash; Yes. Hmm. <br>&mdash; I know what people think of me, but perhaps I am a little more liberal. <br>&mdash; He is. <br>&mdash; I think the moon is far enough for now, don't you, Mr Delaware? <br>&mdash; I figured it might be. <br>&mdash; You could come with us. <br>&mdash; I escape often enough, thank you. <br>&mdash; And I have a promise to live up to. <br>&mdash; You'll understand, soon enough. <br>&mdash; OK, up to you. <br>&mdash; See you next time. Call me. <br>&mdash; What, that's it? <br>&mdash; What's the matter with you? <br>&mdash; Have I forgotten something? <br>&mdash; Oh, shut up. <br>&mdash; Right. <br>&mdash; OK. Interesting. <br>&mdash; What's wrong? <br>&mdash; You're acting like we've never done that before. <br>&mdash; We haven't. <br>&mdash; We haven't? Oh, look at the time, must be off. <br>&mdash; But it was very nice. It was good. <br>&mdash; It was unexpected. <br>&mdash; You know what they say, <br>&mdash; there's a first time for everything. <br>&mdash; And a last time. <br>&mdash; Rory, I'm going to need thermo couplings. <br>&mdash; The green ones and the blue ones. <br>&mdash; OK, hold on. <br>&mdash; So. So? <br>&mdash; You're OK? <br>&mdash; Fine. Head's a bit weird. <br>&mdash; There's lots of stuff I can't quite remember. <br>&mdash; AMY SCREAMS <br>&mdash; After effect of the Silence. Natural enough. <br>&mdash; That's not what I was asking. <br>&mdash; You told me you were pregnant. <br>&mdash; Yes. Why? Because I was. <br>&mdash; I thought I was. Turns out I wasn't. <br>&mdash; No. Why did you tell me? <br>&mdash; You're my friend. <br>&mdash; You're my best friend. <br>&mdash; Did you tell Rory? <br>&mdash; No. <br>&mdash; Amy, why tell me and not Rory? <br>&mdash; Why do you think? <br>&mdash; I travelled with you in this TARDIS for so long. <br>&mdash; All that time. <br>&mdash; If I was pregnant for some of it, wouldn't it have had an effect? <br>&mdash; I don't want to tell Rory, this baby might have three heads, <br>&mdash; or like a time head or something. <br>&mdash; What's a time head? I don't know, but what if it had one? <br>&mdash; A time head? Shut up, all right! <br>&mdash; THEY LAUGH <br>&mdash; Oi! Stupid face. <br>&mdash; Er, yeah. <br>&mdash; Hello. <br>&mdash; Taking that away from you, if you're going to listen in all the time. <br>&mdash; OK, that's a fair point. <br>&mdash; But you should've told me that you thought you were pregnant. <br>&mdash; I'm a nurse, I'm good with pregnancy. <br>&mdash; Not, as it turns out, that good. <br>&mdash; So can you stop being stupid? <br>&mdash; Er, no. Never. I'm never, ever going to stop being stupid! <br>&mdash; So, this little girl, it's all about her. Who was she? <br>&mdash; Or we could just go off and have some adventures. <br>&mdash; Anyone in the mood for adventures? I am. You only live once. <br>&mdash; GIRL COUGHS <br>&mdash; Are you OK? <br>&mdash; Little girl... <br>&mdash; are you OK? It's all right. <br>&mdash; It's quite all right. <br>&mdash; I'm dying...but I can fix that. <br>&mdash; It's easy, really. <br>&mdash; See? <br>&mdash; Yo, ho-ho! Our sensors picked you up, ship in distress. <br>&mdash; It's dangerous here. There is a monster aboard. <br>&mdash; She leaves a mark on men's skin. Doctor, what's happening to me? <br>&mdash; You're stowaways. <br>&mdash; Amy, what are you doing? <br>&mdash; Saving your life. OK with that, are you? <br>&mdash; There's a stroppy, homicidal mermaid trying to kill all. <br>&mdash; She's here. <br></div></body></html>
