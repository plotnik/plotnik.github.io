      <h3>Doctor Who - 6x05 - The Rebel Flesh (1)</h3>
      
    &mdash; Lights. <br>&mdash; Lights! <br>&mdash; You know the drill, people. Plastic visors down and locked. <br>&mdash; Buzzer. <br>&mdash; Reading of 9.7. <br>&mdash; Sounds a bit low for Unrefined. <br>&mdash; How's the average? The acid potency stats have definitely dropped belowthe mean during the last quarter. <br>&mdash; Prettier than a computer, isn't she? Give over, Buzz. Buzzer! Buzz! <br>&mdash; Oh, great. <br>&mdash; Nice going, twinkle toes. <br>&mdash; I shouldn't have swung at him. Sorry, Buzz. My bad. <br>&mdash; NO, you're all right. Jimmy. <br>&mdash; Well, no point carrying you back legless. Sorry Buzzer, you're dead. <br>&mdash; This is a right pain in the armour. <br>&mdash; Heart's gone now. <br>&mdash; Look, we'd best get off. Got to write this one up for the Boss. <br>&mdash; Those suits cost a bomb. <br>&mdash; If I miss my boy's birthday filling out forms I kill you again. <br>&mdash; Lights. <br>&mdash; I'm looking at these readings, Jimmy, and the potencystats are way too low. <br>&mdash; We may have to take that read again. <br>&mdash; This thing is still jamming up on me. <br>&mdash; So I think we'd better talk about what just happened back there. <br>&mdash; I could get compensation. I've seen the holo-ads. <br>&mdash; "Had an accident in the workplace?" Yeah, I have as it goes. <br>&mdash; I've melted. Let it go. <br>&mdash; Just remember, when you're doing your report, it wasn't my fault. <br>&mdash; She took a swing at me. <br>&mdash; I never touched you. You've got two left feet, Buzzer. <br>&mdash; I haven't got two left feet. <br>&mdash; Or any arms, neck, head, the chin This body costs money, love. <br>&mdash; Not as much as that acid suit. <br>&mdash; Oh, lighten up. It's not like anyone was hurt. <br>&mdash; 46. <br>&mdash; Rubbishy, rubbishy, rubbish. <br>&mdash; Hello! It's a double top. Wrong side of the wire, mister. <br>&mdash; You're on the oche, Red. <br>&mdash; Who wants fish and chips? <br>&mdash; I'll drop you both off. Take your time. Don't rush. <br>&mdash; Er... And you? Things to do. <br>&mdash; Things involving other things. <br>&mdash; Well, we'll stay with you. We'll do the other things. <br>&mdash; Nope. Whatever you're up to, I'd personally like to be a part of it. <br>&mdash; What? Solar tsunami. <br>&mdash; Came directly from your sun. A tidal wave of radiation. <br>&mdash; Big, big, big. <br>&mdash; Doctor, my tummy's going funny. <br>&mdash; Well, the gyrator disconnected. Target tracking is out. <br>&mdash; Assume the position! Textbook landing. Behold! <br>&mdash; A cockerel! <br>&mdash; Love a cockerel. <br>&mdash; And underneath, a monastery, 13th century. <br>&mdash; Ooh, we've gone all medieval. <br>&mdash; I'm not sure about that. Really? Medieval expert are you? <br>&mdash; No, it's just that I can hear Dusty Springfield. <br>&mdash; These fissures are new. Solar tsunami sent out a hugewave of gamma particles. <br>&mdash; This is caused by a magnetic quake that occursjust before the wave hits. <br>&mdash; Well, the monastery's standing. <br>&mdash; Yeah, for now. <br>&mdash; Doctor, look. <br>&mdash; Yeah. It's a supply pipe. <br>&mdash; Ceramic inner lining. Something corrosive. <br>&mdash; They're pumping something nasty off this island to the mainland. <br>&mdash; My mum's a massive fan of Dusty Springfield. <br>&mdash; Who isn't? <br>&mdash; Right, let's go satisfy our rabid curiosity. <br>&mdash; So where are these Dusty Springfield loving monks, then? <br>&mdash; I think we're here. This is it. <br>&mdash; Doctor, what are you talking about? We've never been here before. Hmm? <br>&mdash; We came here by accident. Accident? <br>&mdash; Yes, I know. Accident. Ow! Acid. <br>&mdash; They're pumping acid off this island. <br>&mdash; That's old stuff. Fresh acid, you wouldn't have a finger. <br>&mdash; Intruder alert, Intruder alert. There are people coming.Well, almost. <br>&mdash; Almost coming? Almost people. <br>&mdash; I think we should probably be going. Come on. <br>&mdash; I'm telling you, when something runs towards you,it's never for a nice reason. <br>&mdash; What are all these harnesses for? The almost people? <br>&mdash; What are they, prisoners, or are they meditating, or what? <br>&mdash; Well, at the moment they fall into the "or what" category. <br>&mdash; Halt and remain calm. <br>&mdash; Well, we've halted. How are we all doing on the calm front? <br>&mdash; Don't move! <br>&mdash; Stay back, Jen. We don't know who they are. <br>&mdash; So let's ask them. <br>&mdash; Who the hell are you? <br>&mdash; Well, I'm The Doctor and this is Amy and Rory and it'sall very nice, isn't it? <br>&mdash; Hold up. You're all... What are you all, like identical twins? <br>&mdash; This is an AlphaGrade industrial facility. <br>&mdash; Unless you work for the military or for Morpoth Jetson, you are in bigtrouble. <br>&mdash; Actually, you're in big trouble. <br>&mdash; Meteorological Department! <br>&mdash; Since when? Since you were hit by a solar wave. <br>&mdash; Which we survived. <br>&mdash; Just, by the look of it. And there's a bigger one on the way. <br>&mdash; Which we'll also survive. <br>&mdash; Dicken, scan for bugs. <br>&mdash; Backs against the wall! Now! <br>&mdash; You're not a monastery. You're a factory. <br>&mdash; 22nd century, army-owned factory. <br>&mdash; You're army. No, love, we're contractors. <br>&mdash; And you're trespassers. <br>&mdash; It's clear, boss. <br>&mdash; All right, weatherman, your ID checks out. <br>&mdash; If there's another solar storm, what are you going to do about it? <br>&mdash; Hand out sunblock? <br>&mdash; I need to see your critical systems. <br>&mdash; Which one? <br>&mdash; You know which one. <br>&mdash; And there you are. Meet the government's worstkept secret. The Flesh. <br>&mdash; It's fully programmable matter. <br>&mdash; In fact, it's even learning to replicate itselfat the cellular level. <br>&mdash; Right. Brilliant. Lost. <br>&mdash; OK. <br>&mdash; Once a reading's been taken, we can manipulate its molecularstructure into anything. <br>&mdash; Replicate a living organism down to the hairs on its chinny chin chin. <br>&mdash; Even clothes. And everything's identical. <br>&mdash; Eyes, voice... Mind? Soul? <br>&mdash; Don't be fooled, Doctor, it acts like life but it still <br>&mdash; needs to be controlled by us, from those harnesses you saw. <br>&mdash; Wait, whoa, hold it. <br>&mdash; So, you're Flesh now? <br>&mdash; I'm lying in a harness back in that chamber. <br>&mdash; We all are, except Jennifer here. <br>&mdash; Don't be scared. This thing, just like operating a forklift truck. <br>&mdash; You said it could grow. Only living things grow. <br>&mdash; Moss grows. It's no more than that. <br>&mdash; This acid is so dangerous we were losing a worker every week. <br>&mdash; So now we mine the acid using these doppelgangers. Or Gangers. <br>&mdash; If these bodies get burnt or fall in the acid. <br>&mdash; Then who the hell cares? Right, Jen? <br>&mdash; Nerve endings automatically cut off like airbags being discharged. <br>&mdash; We wake up and get a new Ganger. <br>&mdash; It's weird but you get used to it. <br>&mdash; Jennifer, I want you in your Ganger. Get back to the harness. <br>&mdash; Hang on. What's he up to? What you up to, pal? <br>&mdash; Stop it. <br>&mdash; Strange, it was like <br>&mdash; for a moment there it was scanning me. Doctor. <br>&mdash; Get back, Doctor, leave it alone! <br>&mdash; I understand. <br>&mdash; Doctor? <br>&mdash; Are you all right? Incredible. <br>&mdash; You have no idea. <br>&mdash; No idea. <br>&mdash; I mean, I felt it in my mind. I reached out to it, and it to me. <br>&mdash; Don't fiddle with the money, Doctor. <br>&mdash; How can you be so blinkered? It's alive. So alive. <br>&mdash; You're piling your lives, your personalities directly into it. <br>&mdash; It's the solar storm. <br>&mdash; The first waves come in pairs. <br>&mdash; Pre-shock and fore-shock. It's close. <br>&mdash; Buzzer, we got anything from the mainland yet? <br>&mdash; No, the comms are still too jammed with radiation. <br>&mdash; OK, then we'll keep pumping acid until the mainland says stop. <br>&mdash; Now, why don't you stand back and let us impress you? <br>&mdash; ID confirmed. Jennifer Lucas. <br>&mdash; The meter is running. <br>&mdash; Cardio and respiratory online. <br>&mdash; Motor functions online. <br>&mdash; Plumbing in. <br>&mdash; Well, I can see why you keep it in a church. <br>&mdash; Miracle of life. <br>&mdash; No need to get poncey. It's just gunge. <br>&mdash; Guys, we need to get to work. <br>&mdash; OK, everybody, let's crack on. <br>&mdash; Did I mention the solar storm? <br>&mdash; You need to get out of here. <br>&mdash; Where do you want us to go? <br>&mdash; We're on a tiny island. I can get you all off it. <br>&mdash; Don't be ridiculous. We've got a job to do. It's coming. <br>&mdash; That's the alarm. <br>&mdash; How do you get power? We're solar. We use a solar router. <br>&mdash; The weathervane. Big problem. <br>&mdash; Boss, maybe if the storm's back we should get underground. <br>&mdash; The factory's seen better days. <br>&mdash; The acid pipes might not withstand another hit. <br>&mdash; We have 200 tons of acid to pump out. <br>&mdash; We fall behind, we stay another rotation. Anyone want that? <br>&mdash; Please. <br>&mdash; You're making a massive mistake here. <br>&mdash; You're right at the crossroads of it. Don't turn the wrong way. <br>&mdash; If you don't, if you don't prepare for this storm,you are all in terrible danger. <br>&mdash; Understand? <br>&mdash; My factory. <br>&mdash; My rules. <br>&mdash; I need to check the progress of the storm. Monitoring station? <br>&mdash; Monitoring station. <br>&mdash; Three lefts a right and a left. Third door on your left. Thank you. <br>&mdash; Waves disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. <br>&mdash; There is going to be the mother and father of all power surges. <br>&mdash; See this weathervane, the cock-a-doodle-do? <br>&mdash; It's a solar router feeding the whole factory with solar power. <br>&mdash; When that wave hits, kaboom! <br>&mdash; I've to get to that cockerel before all hell breaks loose. <br>&mdash; I never thought I'd get to say that again. <br>&mdash; Amy, breathe! <br>&mdash; Yeah! I mean, thanks. I'll try. <br>&mdash; Oh! <br>&mdash; For want of a better word, "ow"! <br>&mdash; Cleaves! You're not in your harness. <br>&mdash; I'm sorry, Doctor. You were right. You've lost all power to the factory. <br>&mdash; Doctor, I abandoned my team. Then let's go get them. <br>&mdash; How long would you say we were unconscious for, Cleaves? <br>&mdash; Not long. A minute, two minutes? I'd hazard we've been out a teensybit longer. Well, how long? <br>&mdash; An hour. I've seen whole worlds turned inside out in an hour. <br>&mdash; A lot can go wrong in an hour. <br>&mdash; I feel like I been toasted. <br>&mdash; What the hell happened? The tsunami happened. You hurt? <br>&mdash; It feels like the national grid went through mybones but apart from that... <br>&mdash; I hope the meter's not bust. I still want to get paid? <br>&mdash; Jennifer! <br>&mdash; Jennifer. Hey, all right. <br>&mdash; It hurt so much. <br>&mdash; Hey, it's OK. It's over. <br>&mdash; I couldn't get out of my harness. Shh. <br>&mdash; I thought I was going to die. <br>&mdash; Welcome to my world. <br>&mdash; Doctor, these are all real people so where are their Gangers? <br>&mdash; Don't worry. When the link shuts down theGangers return to pure Flesh. <br>&mdash; Now, the storms left us with acid leaks all over so weneed to contact the mainland. <br>&mdash; They can have a rescue shuttle out here in no time. <br>&mdash; That's my record. Who's playing my record? <br>&mdash; Your Gangers, they've gone walkabout. No, it's impossible. <br>&mdash; They're not active. Cars don't fly themselves, cranes don't liftthemselves and Gangers don't... <br>&mdash; No way. I don't... <br>&mdash; I don't believe this. <br>&mdash; They could've escaped through the service door at the back. <br>&mdash; This is just like the Isle of Sheppy. <br>&mdash; It would seem the storm has animated your Gangers. <br>&mdash; They've ransacked everything. <br>&mdash; Not ransacked. Searched. Through our stuff! <br>&mdash; Their stuff. Searching for what? Confirmation. <br>&mdash; They need to know their memories are real. <br>&mdash; Oh, so they've got flaming memories now! <br>&mdash; They feel compelled to connect to their lives. <br>&mdash; Their stolen lives. <br>&mdash; No. Bequeathed. You gave them this. <br>&mdash; You poured in your personalities, emotions, traits, memories, secretseverything. You gave them your lives. <br>&mdash; Human lives are amazing. <br>&mdash; Are you surprised they walked off with them? <br>&mdash; I'll say it again Isle of Sheppy. <br>&mdash; Ganger got an electric shock, toddled off, killed his operator <br>&mdash; right there in his harness. I've seen the photos.This bloke's ear was all hanging... <br>&mdash; Even if this has actually happened, they can't remain stable without usplumbed in to them. Can they, boss? <br>&mdash; Guess we'll find out. Are you OK? <br>&mdash; Do you need some water? <br>&mdash; I feel funny. <br>&mdash; I need the washroom. <br>&mdash; I'll come with you. Sorry. <br>&mdash; That's me. <br>&mdash; It's good to have a hobby. So, what? <br>&mdash; My Ganger did that all on its own? <br>&mdash; Who taught you to do this? <br>&mdash; Granddad. <br>&mdash; Well, your Ganger's granddad taught him to do it too. <br>&mdash; You both have the same childhood memories, just as clear,just as real. <br>&mdash; No. Scared, disorientated, struggling to come to terms withan entire life in their heads. <br>&mdash; The Doctor's always saying, "Don't wander off. " <br>&mdash; First rule with him actually, don't wander off. <br>&mdash; I just need a minute. <br>&mdash; Oh, yeah. Sure. <br>&mdash; Take all the time you need. <br>&mdash; I've got your back. <br>&mdash; You're fine. <br>&mdash; Uh, Jennifer? <br>&mdash; What's up, Jennifer? <br>&mdash; We... We'd better get going. <br>&mdash; Everything OK in there, Jen? <br>&mdash; Just let us live! <br>&mdash; We need to protect ourselves. <br>&mdash; Are you a violent man, Jimmy? No. <br>&mdash; Then why would the other Jimmy be? <br>&mdash; Don't tell me you can eat at a time like this, Doctor. <br>&mdash; You told me we were out cold for a few minutes, Cleaves,when in fact it was an hour. <br>&mdash; Sorry. I just assumed... <br>&mdash; It's not your fault. Like I said, they're disoriented. <br>&mdash; Amy, when you got to the alcoves who was in harness? <br>&mdash; Jimmy and Dicken were helping Buzzer out. Jennifer? <br>&mdash; She was standing on her own when we got to her. <br>&mdash; It's hot. <br>&mdash; Trans-matter's still a little rubbery. <br>&mdash; Nerve endings not quite fused properly. <br>&mdash; What are you talking about? It's OK. <br>&mdash; Why didn't I feel that? You will. <br>&mdash; You'll stabilise. <br>&mdash; No. Stop it! You're playing stupid games. <br>&mdash; Stop it! <br>&mdash; You don't have to hide. <br>&mdash; Please, trust me, I'm The Doctor. <br>&mdash; Where's the real Cleaves, you thing? <br>&mdash; What have you done with her? <br>&mdash; That's it. Good, you remember. <br>&mdash; This is early Flesh. The early stages of the technology. So much to learn. <br>&mdash; Doctor, what's happened to her? She can't stabilise, <br>&mdash; she's shifting between half-formed and full-formed, for now at least. <br>&mdash; We are living. <br>&mdash; Let her go. Doctor, Rory. Rory? <br>&mdash; Rory! <br>&mdash; Oh, Rory. Rory! Always with the Rory. <br>&mdash; Explosion must've ruptured the acid feeds.We're going to need the acid suits. <br>&mdash; No, no, no. We haven't got time. Back, back, back! <br>&mdash; Rory. <br>&mdash; Rory. <br>&mdash; Rory. Rory. <br>&mdash; Of course Jennifer's a Ganger too. <br>&mdash; Doctor, you said they wouldn't be violent. <br>&mdash; But I did say they were scared and angry. <br>&mdash; And early technology is what you said. <br>&mdash; You seem to know something about the Flesh. Do you? <br>&mdash; Doctor? <br>&mdash; You're no weatherman. <br>&mdash; Why are you really here? <br>&mdash; I have to talk to them. I can fix this. <br>&mdash; Wait. What's going on? Where's the real Jennifer? <br>&mdash; It is too dangerous out here with acid leaks. We have to find Rory. <br>&mdash; Yes, I'm going back to the TARDIS. Wait for me in the dining hall. <br>&mdash; I want us to keep together, OK. No more wandering off. What about Rory? <br>&mdash; Well, it would be safer to look for Rory and Jennifer with the TARDIS. <br>&mdash; Here we go. <br>&mdash; Distress flares. <br>&mdash; Exit? Keep going straight. <br>&mdash; Can't miss it. But you're never going to get your vehicle in here. <br>&mdash; I'm a great parker. <br>&mdash; We really need those acid suits. <br>&mdash; I've sent Buzzer and Dicken to get them. <br>&mdash; Fine and dandy. I'm just going to find my husband. So, cheers. <br>&mdash; Amy, I wouldn't. Nor would I. <br>&mdash; What can you do, eh? <br>&mdash; At least wait for an acid suit. <br>&mdash; When I was a little girl, <br>&mdash; I got lost on the moors, wandered off from the picnic. <br>&mdash; I can still feel how sore my toes got inside my red wellie boots. <br>&mdash; And I imagined another little girl just like me in red wellies. <br>&mdash; And she was Jennifer too. <br>&mdash; Except she was a strong Jennifer, <br>&mdash; a tough Jennifer. <br>&mdash; She'd lead me home. <br>&mdash; My name is Jennifer Lucas. <br>&mdash; I am not a factory part. <br>&mdash; I had toast for my breakfast. <br>&mdash; I wrote a letter to my mum. <br>&mdash; And then you arrived. <br>&mdash; I noticed your eyes right off. <br>&mdash; Did you? <br>&mdash; Nice eyes. Kind. <br>&mdash; Where is the real Jennifer? <br>&mdash; I am Jennifer Lucas! <br>&mdash; I remember everything that happened in her entire life. <br>&mdash; Every birthday, every childhood illness. <br>&mdash; I feel everything she has ever felt and more. <br>&mdash; I'm not a monster! <br>&mdash; I am me. Me! <br>&mdash; Me! Me! <br>&mdash; Why did they do this to us? <br>&mdash; Help me, Rory. Help me. <br>&mdash; Shh, shh. <br>&mdash; Trust me. <br>&mdash; What are you doing down there? <br>&mdash; Clear. <br>&mdash; Those damn Gangers got to the acid suits! <br>&mdash; There is acid leaking everywhere. <br>&mdash; Did you see the boss' eyes back there in the hall? <br>&mdash; I've never seen a Ganger look at me like that. <br>&mdash; I don't know what they are now but <br>&mdash; they ain't us. <br>&mdash; We have the advantage now. <br>&mdash; We have the acid suits. <br>&mdash; We can move freely, strike at will. <br>&mdash; Are you sure you're feeling better? <br>&mdash; No more super-elastic punches? <br>&mdash; I'm different now. <br>&mdash; Stronger. The Doctor won't hurt you. <br>&mdash; He wants to help, Jennifer. OK? <br>&mdash; You used my name. <br>&mdash; You used my name. Thank you. <br>&mdash; Amy's a lucky girl. <br>&mdash; Yeah. She is. <br>&mdash; Let's go. <br>&mdash; Rory. Rory? <br>&mdash; Amy! <br>&mdash; You're OK! <br>&mdash; What happened? <br>&mdash; She needs protecting. Jen? <br>&mdash; No, it's a Ganger. <br>&mdash; Rory, listen.. <br>&mdash; Look, you listen! Nobody touches her. <br>&mdash; Hello. <br>&mdash; How are you all getting on? Why don't you tell us? <br>&mdash; Well, we have two choices. The first is to tear each other apart. <br>&mdash; Not my favourite. The second is to knuckle down and work together, <br>&mdash; try to work out how best we can help you. <br>&mdash; Now, I know its hard for you to hold your fully human form. <br>&mdash; That's why you keep shifting between the Flesh stages but do try. <br>&mdash; It'll make the others less scared of you. <br>&mdash; Where's Jen? What have you done with her? <br>&mdash; I haven't seen her. I swear! <br>&mdash; But look, I'm her. I'm just like her. I'm real. <br>&mdash; You're a copy. <br>&mdash; You're just pretending to be like her. <br>&mdash; Rory, we don't really know anything about them yet. <br>&mdash; Well, I know that she's afraid and she needs our help. <br>&mdash; Jimmy, Buzzer, come on, you guys. <br>&mdash; We've worked together for two years. <br>&mdash; I worked with Jennifer Lucas, not you. <br>&mdash; OK, let's not do anything at all until... <br>&mdash; The Doctor gets here. Hello <br>&mdash; This is... You're telling me. <br>&mdash; All right, Doctor, you've brought us together, now what? <br>&mdash; Before we do anything, I have one very important question. <br>&mdash; Has anybody got a pair of shoes I could borrow? <br>&mdash; Size 10, although I should warn you I have very wide feet. <br>&mdash; That's it, Doctor befriend them, team up with them, why don't you? <br>&mdash; Make a football team. How about that? <br>&mdash; You're going to have us all together singing campfire songs. <br>&mdash; The Flesh was never merely moss. <br>&mdash; These are not copies. The storm has hardwired them. <br>&mdash; They are becoming people. <br>&mdash; With souls? Rubbish! <br>&mdash; Bless you. <br>&mdash; We were all jelly once. <br>&mdash; Little jelly eggs sitting in goop. Yes, thanks, too much information. <br>&mdash; We are not talking about an accident that needs to be mopped up. <br>&mdash; We are talking about sacred life. Do you understand? <br>&mdash; Good. Now, the TARDIS is trapped in an acid pool. <br>&mdash; Once I can reach her, I can get you all off this island, humansand Gangers. How does that sound? <br>&mdash; Can I make it home for Adam's birthday? <br>&mdash; What about me? <br>&mdash; He's my son too. You? <br>&mdash; You really think that? I feel it. <br>&mdash; Oh, so you were there when he was born, were you? Yeah. <br>&mdash; I drank about eight pints of tea. <br>&mdash; Then they told me I had a wee boy and I just burst out laughing, <br>&mdash; no idea why. <br>&mdash; I miss home, <br>&mdash; as much as you. <br>&mdash; I'm not going to lie to you, it's a right old mess, this. <br>&mdash; But as you might say up North, "Oh, well, I'll just goto't foot of stairs". <br>&mdash; Ee by by gum. Or not. Good. Right. <br>&mdash; First step is we get everyone together, then get everyone safe. <br>&mdash; Then get everyone out of here. <br>&mdash; But we're still missing Jennifer and Cleaves. I'll go and look for them. <br>&mdash; I'll give you a hand, if you like? <br>&mdash; Cover more ground. <br>&mdash; Yeah, ok. Thanks. This circus has gone on long enough. <br>&mdash; Oh, great! <br>&mdash; You see, that is just so typically me. <br>&mdash; Doctor, tell it to shut up! <br>&mdash; Cleaves, no. No, no. Circuit probe. <br>&mdash; Fires about 40,000 volts. Would kill any one of us. <br>&mdash; So I guess she'll work on Gangers just the same. <br>&mdash; It's interesting you refer to them as it but you call aglorified cattle prod a she. <br>&mdash; When the real people are safely off this island then I'll happily talk <br>&mdash; philosophy over a pint with you, Doctor. <br>&mdash; What are you going to do to them? <br>&mdash; Sorry, they're monsters. Mistakes. <br>&mdash; They have to be destroyed. Give me the probe, Cleaves. <br>&mdash; We always have to take charge, don't we, Miranda. <br>&mdash; Even when we don't really know what the hell is going on. <br>&mdash; Agh! <br>&mdash; He's dead!. We call it decommissioned. <br>&mdash; You stopped his heart. He had a heart. <br>&mdash; Aorta, valves, a real human heart. <br>&mdash; And you stopped it. <br>&mdash; Jen? What happened to Buzzer will happen to all of us if we trust you. <br>&mdash; Wait, wait. Just wait. <br>&mdash; No! Idiot! Wait! <br>&mdash; Look at what you have done, Cleaves! <br>&mdash; If it's war, then it's war. <br>&mdash; You don't get it, Doctor. <br>&mdash; How can you? <br>&mdash; It's us and them now. <br>&mdash; Us and them. <br>&mdash; Us and them. <br>&mdash; Us and them. <br>&mdash; You tried. We all tried and look what they did. <br>&mdash; Us and them now. <br>&mdash; Us and them. <br>&mdash; Us and them. <br>&mdash; Jennifer. Buzzer warned you it was a trick and now he's dead. <br>&mdash; If we want to live, <br>&mdash; then it's time to go to war. <br>&mdash; I'll take care of the spare one running around out there. <br>&mdash; Trust me. <br>&mdash; I just wanted to help her. <br>&mdash; Well, we all do, OK. Don't be like that. <br>&mdash; Listen, she's... I said I agree with you. Drop it. <br>&mdash; The most fortified and defendable room in the monastery. <br>&mdash; Cleaves, the most fortified and defendable room in the monastery. <br>&mdash; The chapel. Thank you. Only one way in. <br>&mdash; Stone walls, two feet thick. <br>&mdash; You've crossed one hell of a line, Cleaves. You've killed one of them. <br>&mdash; They are coming back. <br>&mdash; In a big way. <br>&mdash; Jennifer. Rory. <br>&mdash; What about the flares? We'll worry about the flares whenwe're locked inside. Rory, Pond. <br>&mdash; Rory, come on! <br>&mdash; Jen's out there. She's out there and she's on her own.
