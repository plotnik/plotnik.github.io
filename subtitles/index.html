      <h3>Doctor Who - 5x11 - The Lodger</h3>
      
    &mdash; No, Amy, it's definitely not the fifth moon of Sinda Callista. <br>&mdash; I think I can see a Ryman's. <br>&mdash; Amy! Amy! <br>&mdash; Argh! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; It's saying we're on Earth! <br>&mdash; Essex, Colchester. <br>&mdash; Doctor?! <br>&mdash; It's taking off again. <br>&mdash; Doctor, can you hear me? <br>&mdash; Amy! <br>&mdash; Amy... <br>&mdash; 'Hello? Hello, please? Hello?' <br>&mdash; 'I need your help. There's been an accident. ' <br>&mdash; 'Please, help me. ' <br>&mdash; Hello? <br>&mdash; Please, will you help me? <br>&mdash; Help you? <br>&mdash; What's wrong? <br>&mdash; Something terrible's happened. <br>&mdash; Please help me. <br>&mdash; Craig, what's that on the ceiling? <br>&mdash; - What's what on the ceiling? - That! <br>&mdash; It's coming from upstairs. <br>&mdash; Who lives up there again? <br>&mdash; Just some bloke. <br>&mdash; So what's the plan tonight? Pizza, booze, telly? <br>&mdash; Yeah, pizza, booze, telly. <br>&mdash; What is he doing up there? <br>&mdash; - You put the advert up yet? - Yeah, did it today, paper shop window. <br>&mdash; "One furnished room available immediately, shared kitchen, <br>&mdash; "bathroom, with 27-year-old male, non smoker, Â£400 pcm <br>&mdash; - per calendar month - suit young professional. " <br>&mdash; Mmm, sounds ideal. That's your mission in life, Craig. <br>&mdash; - Find me a man! - Yeah, otherwise you'll have to settle for me. <br>&mdash; You'll have to settle for me first. <br>&mdash; Oh, Melina again. What? <br>&mdash; .. Right. <br>&mdash; .. Yeah, but I've kind of got plans. <br>&mdash; .. No, it's nothing important, it's just Craig. - Oh, thanks, Soph. <br>&mdash; Sorry, you know what I mean! <br>&mdash; .. OK. I'll talk to Craig, OK. <br>&mdash; Now she's having a Dylan crisis on top of the Clare crisis. <br>&mdash; It could be another all-nighter. <br>&mdash; I'm sorry, but I really should go. <br>&mdash; Do you mind if I go? <br>&mdash; No, not at all. No, honestly, course not, go. <br>&mdash; - Cos I could stay. - No, go on. - I mean, we've got plans. <br>&mdash; Just pizza. <br>&mdash; Yeah, it's just pizza. <br>&mdash; OK! Right, I'm going. <br>&mdash; - All right, then. Well, um, I'll see you soon. - Yeah. <br>&mdash; All right, and give me a call, I hope everything's OK. <br>&mdash; Thanks, sorry. <br>&mdash; Just tell her. <br>&mdash; Just tell her. "I love you. " <br>&mdash; "I love you. " Oh, jus.. <br>&mdash; "Hey, I don't know if you knew... " <br>&mdash; Oh! <br>&mdash; Every time! <br>&mdash; I love you. I love you. <br>&mdash; I love you. <br>&mdash; I love you! <br>&mdash; I love you! <br>&mdash; Well, that's good, cos I'm your new lodger. Do you know, <br>&mdash; this is going to be easier than I expected! <br>&mdash; Corrected by <font color="#00ff00">Lauta</font> www.Addic7ed.com <br>&mdash; But I only just put the advert up today, I didn't put my address. <br>&mdash; Well, aren't you lucky I came along? More lucky than you know. <br>&mdash; Less of a young professional, more of an ancient amateur, <br>&mdash; but frankly I'm an absolute dream. <br>&mdash; Hang on, mate, I don't know if I want you staying, <br>&mdash; and give me back those keys, you can't have those! <br>&mdash; Yes, quite right. Have some rent. <br>&mdash; That's probably quite a lot, isn't it? Looks like a lot. <br>&mdash; Is it a lot? I can never tell. <br>&mdash; Don't spend it all on sweets. Unless you like sweets. I like sweets. Ooh. <br>&mdash; That's how we greet each other nowadays, isn't it? I'm the Doctor. <br>&mdash; Well, they call me the Doctor, I don't know why. <br>&mdash; I call me the Doctor too. Still don't know why. <br>&mdash; - Craig Owens. The Doctor? - Yep. <br>&mdash; - Who lives upstairs? - Just some bloke. <br>&mdash; What does he look like? <br>&mdash; Normal. He's very quiet. <br>&mdash; Usually. <br>&mdash; Sorry, who are you again? <br>&mdash; Hello?! Excuse me? <br>&mdash; Ah! I suppose that's... dry rot? <br>&mdash; - Or damp. Or mildew. - Or none of the above. <br>&mdash; - I'll get someone to fix it. - No, I'll fix it. <br>&mdash; I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. <br>&mdash; No, I'm the Doctor, don't call me the Rotmeister. <br>&mdash; This is the most beautiful parlour I have ever seen, <br>&mdash; you're obviously a man of impeccable taste. <br>&mdash; I can stay, Craig, can't I? Say I can. <br>&mdash; - You haven't even seen the room. - The room? - Your room. <br>&mdash; My room? Oh, yes, my room, my room. <br>&mdash; Take me to my room! <br>&mdash; Yeah, this is Mark's old room, he owns the place, moved out about a month ago. <br>&mdash; An uncle he'd never even heard of died and left a load of money. <br>&mdash; How very convenient. <br>&mdash; This'll do just right. In fact... <br>&mdash; No time to lose. I'll take it. <br>&mdash; Ah... you'll want to see my credentials. <br>&mdash; There... National Insurance number... <br>&mdash; NHS number... <br>&mdash; - References... - Is that a reference from the Archbishop of Canterbury? <br>&mdash; I'm his special favourite. <br>&mdash; Are you hungry? I'm hungry. <br>&mdash; I haven't got anything in. <br>&mdash; You've got everything I need for an omelette fines herbes! Pour deux! <br>&mdash; So who's the girl on the fridge? <br>&mdash; My friend. Sophie. <br>&mdash; - Girlfriend? - A friend who is a girl. There's nothing going on. <br>&mdash; Ah, that's completely normal. Works for me. <br>&mdash; We met at work about a year ago at the call centre. <br>&mdash; Oh, really, a communications exchange? That could be handy. <br>&mdash; Firm's going down though. The bosses are using a totally rubbish business model. <br>&mdash; I know what they should do, I got a plan all worked out, <br>&mdash; but I'm just a phone drone, I can't go running in saying I know best. <br>&mdash; Why am I telling you this? I don't even know you. <br>&mdash; I've got one of those faces. <br>&mdash; People never stop blurting out their plans while I'm around. <br>&mdash; Right, where's your stuff? <br>&mdash; Don't worry, it'll materialise, if all goes to plan. <br>&mdash; Oh, which one, which one?! No! <br>&mdash; Why won't you land?! <br>&mdash; Oh, that was incredible! <br>&mdash; That was absolutely brilliant. <br>&mdash; Where did you learn to cook? <br>&mdash; Paris, in the 18th century. No, hang on, <br>&mdash; that's not recent, is it? 17th? <br>&mdash; No, no, no, 20th. Sorry, I'm not used to doing them in the right order. <br>&mdash; Has anyone ever told you that you're a bit weird? <br>&mdash; They never really stop. Ever been to Paris, Craig? <br>&mdash; Nah, I can't see the point of Paris. <br>&mdash; - I'm not much of a traveller. - I can tell from your sofa. <br>&mdash; - My sofa? - You're starting to look like it. <br>&mdash; Thanks, mate, that's lovely! <br>&mdash; No, I like it here. <br>&mdash; I'd miss it, I'd miss... <br>&mdash; - Those keys? - What? <br>&mdash; You're sort of... <br>&mdash; ...fondling them. <br>&mdash; - I'm holding them. - Right. <br>&mdash; Anyway... <br>&mdash; these... <br>&mdash; these are your keys. <br>&mdash; - I can stay? - Yeah, you're weird and you can cook, it's good enough for me. <br>&mdash; Right, outdoor, front door, <br>&mdash; your door. - My door. My place. My gaff. Ha-ha! Yes! <br>&mdash; Me with a key. <br>&mdash; And listen, Mark and I, we had an arrangement where <br>&mdash; if you ever need me out of your hair, just give me a shout, OK? <br>&mdash; Why would I want that? <br>&mdash; In case you want to bring someone round. A girlfriend or... <br>&mdash; a boyfriend? <br>&mdash; Oh, I will. I'll shout if that happens. <br>&mdash; Yes. Something like... <br>&mdash; I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS! <br>&mdash; By the way, that... <br>&mdash; the rot. <br>&mdash; I've got the strangest feeling we shouldn't touch it. <br>&mdash; Earth to Pond, Earth to Pond. <br>&mdash; Come in, Pond. <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; - Oooh. - Sorry! - Could you not wreck my new earpiece, Pond? <br>&mdash; No, I mean, he seems a laugh. <br>&mdash; He's a bit weird, good weird, you know? <br>&mdash; - 'And he just happens to have three grand on him in a paper bag?' - Yeah. <br>&mdash; Wait, wait. "The Doctor"?! <br>&mdash; 'Craig, what if he's a dealer?!' <br>&mdash; 'Hello. Stop, please. ' <br>&mdash; 'Can you hear me? I need your help. ' <br>&mdash; How's the TARDIS coping? <br>&mdash; See for yourself. <br>&mdash; Ooh, nasty. <br>&mdash; She's locked in a materialisation loop, trying to land again but she can't. <br>&mdash; And whatever's stopping her is upstairs in that flat. <br>&mdash; So go upstairs and sort it! <br>&mdash; 'Please. My little girl's hurt. ' <br>&mdash; I don't know what it is yet! <br>&mdash; Anything that can stop the TARDIS from landing is big, scary big! <br>&mdash; Wait... aren't you scared? <br>&mdash; I'm so sorry, but will you help me? Please. <br>&mdash; Help you? <br>&mdash; 'A bow tie, are you serious?!' <br>&mdash; Hang on a sec. <br>&mdash; What? Craig, Craig? <br>&mdash; Arbuckle, rare tarantula on the table, ooh! <br>&mdash; I can't go up there until I know what it is and how to deal with it! <br>&mdash; It is vital that this "man" upstairs doesn't realise who and what I am. <br>&mdash; So no sonicking. <br>&mdash; No advanced technology. I can only use this cos we're on scramble. <br>&mdash; To anyone else hearing this conversation, we're talking absolute gibberish. <br>&mdash; Practical eruption in chicken. <br>&mdash; Descartes Lombardy spiral. <br>&mdash; All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. <br>&mdash; Simple. What could possibly go wrong? <br>&mdash; - 'Have you seen you?' - So you're just going to be snide? No helpful hints? <br>&mdash; Hmm, well, here's one... bow tie, get rid! <br>&mdash; Bow ties are cool. <br>&mdash; Come on, Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do. <br>&mdash; They watch telly, they play football, they go down the pub. <br>&mdash; I could do those things! I don't, but I could! <br>&mdash; Hang on. Wait, wait, wait! Amy?! <br>&mdash; Interesting. <br>&mdash; Localised time loop. <br>&mdash; - Ow! What's all that? - Time distortion. <br>&mdash; Whatever's happening upstairs, is still affecting you. <br>&mdash; It's stopped... ish! <br>&mdash; - 'How about your end?' - My end's good. <br>&mdash; 'So, doesn't sound great, but nothing to worry about?' <br>&mdash; No, no, no, not really! <br>&mdash; Just keep the zigzag plotter on full, that'll protect you. <br>&mdash; Ah! <br>&mdash; Amy, I said the zigzag plotter! I pulled the zigzag plotter! <br>&mdash; - What, you're standing with the door behind you? - Yes! <br>&mdash; OK, take two steps to your right and pull it again! <br>&mdash; - Oh. - Now, I must not use the sonic. <br>&mdash; - I've got work to do, need to pick up a few items. - Hey! <br>&mdash; Ssh! <br>&mdash; Don't get comfortable! <br>&mdash; - Doctor! - Hello?! <br>&mdash; How long are you going to be in there? <br>&mdash; Oh, sorry, I like a good soak! <br>&mdash; - What the hell was that? - What did you say? <br>&mdash; I'm just going to go upstairs, see if he's OK. <br>&mdash; Sorry? <br>&mdash; What did you say? <br>&mdash; Yes? Hello? <br>&mdash; Craig? <br>&mdash; Ow! <br>&mdash; It's me from downstairs. I heard a big bang. <br>&mdash; No choice... it's sonicking time. <br>&mdash; Thank you, Craig, but I don't need your help. <br>&mdash; Oops! <br>&mdash; - What happened, what's going on? - Is that my toothbrush? <br>&mdash; - Correct. You spoke to the man upstairs? - Yeah. <br>&mdash; What did he look like? More normal than you do at the moment. <br>&mdash; - What are you doing? - I thought you might be in trouble. <br>&mdash; Thanks. Well if I ever am, you can come and save me with my toothbrush. <br>&mdash; - Ooh! Hello? - Ah! <br>&mdash; Hello! The Doctor. <br>&mdash; Right. You must be Sophie. <br>&mdash; Mm-hm. <br>&mdash; Oh... oh! <br>&mdash; No, Dom's in Malta, there's nobody around. Hang on a sec. <br>&mdash; We've got a match today, pub league, we're one down if you fancy it? <br>&mdash; Pub league? A drinking competition? <br>&mdash; - No... football... play football? - Football. Football! <br>&mdash; Yes, blokes play football! I'm good at football, I think. <br>&mdash; You've saved my life! I've got somebody. <br>&mdash; All right, see you down there. <br>&mdash; - Hey, Soph. - Hey, I thought I'd come early and meet your new flatmate. <br>&mdash; Do you play, Sophie? <br>&mdash; No, Soph just stands on the sidelines, she's my mascot. <br>&mdash; I'm your mascot? Mascot?! <br>&mdash; Well, not my mascot, it's a football match, I can't take a date. <br>&mdash; - I didn't say I was your date. - Neither did I. <br>&mdash; Better get dressed. <br>&mdash; - Oh, the spare kit's just in the bottom drawer. - Bit of a mess. <br>&mdash; - What d'you think? - You didn't say he was gorgeous! <br>&mdash; You unlocked the door. How did you do that? Those are your keys, <br>&mdash; you must have left them last time you came here. <br>&mdash; Yeah, but I... How do you know these are my keys? <br>&mdash; - I've been holding them! - I have got another set. <br>&mdash; - You've got two sets of keys to someone else's house? - Yeah. <br>&mdash; I see! <br>&mdash; You must like it here too. <br>&mdash; So I'm going out, if I hang about the house all the time, <br>&mdash; him upstairs might get suspicious, notice me. <br>&mdash; Football, OK, well done, that is normal. <br>&mdash; 'Yeah, football, all outdoorsy. ' <br>&mdash; Now, football's the one with the sticks, isn't it? <br>&mdash; What are you actually called, what's your proper name? <br>&mdash; - Just call me the Doctor. - Yeah. <br>&mdash; I can't say to these guys, "Hey, this is <br>&mdash; my new flatmate, he's called the Doctor. " <br>&mdash; - Why not? - Cos it's weird. <br>&mdash; - All right, Craig. Soph. - All right, mate. <br>&mdash; Hello, I'm Craig's new flatmate. <br>&mdash; - I'm called the Doctor. - All right, Doctor. I'm Sean. <br>&mdash; - Where are you strongest? - Arms. <br>&mdash; No, he means, what position? On the field? <br>&mdash; Not sure. The front? The side? <br>&mdash; - Below? - Are you any good though? <br>&mdash; Let's find out! <br>&mdash; That's not bad. <br>&mdash; Yes. Go! <br>&mdash; One two, one two! <br>&mdash; Go on, Doctor, go on, Doctor! <br>&mdash; You're brilliant, you're amazing! <br>&mdash; Come on, Craig, show them what you've got! <br>&mdash; I love this game! <br>&mdash; Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor! <br>&mdash; 'Please can you help me? <br>&mdash; 'Can you help me, please?' <br>&mdash; 'Can you help me?' <br>&mdash; Hello? <br>&mdash; I've lost my mum, I don't know where she is. Please can you help me? <br>&mdash; Help you? <br>&mdash; You poor thing, what's happened? <br>&mdash; Can you help me find her? <br>&mdash; You are so on the team! Next week we've got <br>&mdash; the Crown and Anchor, we'll annihilate them! <br>&mdash; No violence, not while I'm around, <br>&mdash; not today, not ever. I'm the Doctor, the oncoming storm... <br>&mdash; and you meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? <br>&mdash; - Yeah. - Lovely, what sort of time? <br>&mdash; Amy? Amy? <br>&mdash; - It's happening again! Worse! - What does the scanner say? <br>&mdash; A lot of nines. Is it good that they're nines? <br>&mdash; Tell me it's good that they're all nines! <br>&mdash; Yes, yes, it's... it's good! Zigzag plotter, zigzag plotter, Amy. <br>&mdash; Argh! <br>&mdash; Amy? Are you there? <br>&mdash; - 'Amy?' - Yes, hello. <br>&mdash; Ah, thank heavens. I thought the TARDIS had been flung off <br>&mdash; into the vortex with you inside it, lost forever. <br>&mdash; You mean that could actually happen!? <br>&mdash; - You have got to get me out of here. - How are the numbers? <br>&mdash; All fives. <br>&mdash; Fives? <br>&mdash; Even better. <br>&mdash; 'Still, it means the effect's almost unbelievably <br>&mdash; powerful and dangerous, but don't worry. ' <br>&mdash; Hang on, OK? <br>&mdash; - 'I've got some rewiring to do. ' - Hey! You... "hang on"! <br>&mdash; Hello, flatmate. <br>&mdash; Hey, man. <br>&mdash; Listen, Sophie's coming round tonight and I <br>&mdash; was wondering if you could give us some space? <br>&mdash; Oh, don't mind me. You won't even know I'm here. <br>&mdash; That's the idea. <br>&mdash; Yes, perfect! What a beauty! <br>&mdash; - That's got bigger. - Oh, yeah. <br>&mdash; Are we going out? <br>&mdash; I've had a bit of a weird day, can we do pizza-booze-telly? <br>&mdash; Great, love it! Wait. <br>&mdash; No Melina, no crises, no interruptions. <br>&mdash; Great. Excellent. <br>&mdash; Um, Soph... <br>&mdash; I've... <br>&mdash; I think... <br>&mdash; Where's this going? <br>&mdash; I think that we... <br>&mdash; ...should... <br>&mdash; Mm? <br>&mdash; - Hello. - What? <br>&mdash; Whoops, sorry, don't worry, I wasn't listening, <br>&mdash; in a world of my own down there. - I thought you were going out? <br>&mdash; Just re-connecting all the electrics, it's a real mess. <br>&mdash; Where's the on-switch for this? <br>&mdash; - He really is on his way out. - No, I don't mind, if you don't mind. <br>&mdash; - I don't mind, why would I mind? - Then stay, have a drink with us. <br>&mdash; - What, do I have to stay now? - Do you want to stay? - I don't mind. <br>&mdash; - OK! - Great! <br>&mdash; Cos life can seem pointless, Doctor. <br>&mdash; Work, weekend, work, weekend. <br>&mdash; And there's six billion people on the planet doing pretty much the same. <br>&mdash; Six billion people? Watching you two at work, <br>&mdash; I'm starting to wonder where they all come from. <br>&mdash; - What? What do you mean by that? - So, the call centre. That's no good? <br>&mdash; What do you really want to do? <br>&mdash; Don't laugh. I only ever told Craig about it. <br>&mdash; I want to work looking after animals. <br>&mdash; Maybe abroad? I saw this orang-utan sanctuary on telly. <br>&mdash; - What's stopping you? - She can't, you need loads of qualifications. <br>&mdash; Yeah, true. Plus it's scary, everyone I know lives round here. <br>&mdash; Craig got offered a job in London, better money, didn't take it. <br>&mdash; What's wrong with staying here? I can't see the point of London. <br>&mdash; Perhaps you'll just have to stay here, <br>&mdash; secure and a little bit miserable until the day you drop. <br>&mdash; Better than trying and failing, eh? <br>&mdash; - You think I'd fail? - Everybody's got dreams, Sophie, <br>&mdash; very few are going to achieve them, so why pretend? <br>&mdash; Perhaps, in the whole universe, a call centre is where you should be? <br>&mdash; - Why are you saying that? That's horrible. - Is it true? <br>&mdash; Of course it's not true. I'm not staying in a <br>&mdash; call centre all my life, I can do anything I want! <br>&mdash; Oh! Yeah! Right! <br>&mdash; Oh, my God! Did you see what he just did? <br>&mdash; No, what's happening? Are you going to live with monkeys now? <br>&mdash; It's a big old world, Sophie. <br>&mdash; Work out what's really keeping you here, eh? <br>&mdash; I don't know. <br>&mdash; Dunno. <br>&mdash; So, are you going to be taking off then, seeing the world? <br>&mdash; What? Do you think I should? <br>&mdash; Yeah... <br>&mdash; Like the Doctor says, what's keeping you here? <br>&mdash; Yeah, exactly! What? <br>&mdash; - Bye. - See you. <br>&mdash; - See you in a bit. - Yeah. <br>&mdash; Right. Shield's up. <br>&mdash; Let's scan! <br>&mdash; 'What are you getting?' <br>&mdash; Upstairs. No traces of high technology. <br>&mdash; Totally normal. <br>&mdash; No no, no, no, it can't be! <br>&mdash; It's too normal. <br>&mdash; Only for you could too normal be a problem. <br>&mdash; You said I could be lost forever. Just go upstairs. <br>&mdash; Without knowing, get myself killed, then you really are lost. <br>&mdash; If I could just get a look in there... <br>&mdash; Hold on. <br>&mdash; Use the data bank, get me the plans of this <br>&mdash; building... its history, the layout, everything. <br>&mdash; Meanwhile, I shall recruit a spy. <br>&mdash; The Rotmeister... <br>&mdash; Ahh! <br>&mdash; Ow! <br>&mdash; Craig! <br>&mdash; Craig? Breakfast, it's normal. <br>&mdash; Craig? <br>&mdash; Craig! <br>&mdash; Craig, I told you not to touch it! What's that? <br>&mdash; An unfamiliar and obviously poisonous substance. <br>&mdash; "Oh, I know what would be really clever, I'll stick my hand in it!" <br>&mdash; Come on, Craig, breathe. <br>&mdash; Come on, Craig, breathe! Thems are healthy footballer's lungs! <br>&mdash; Right. Reverse the enzyme decay. <br>&mdash; Excite the tannin molecules. <br>&mdash; - I've got to go to work. - On no account. You need rest. <br>&mdash; One more. <br>&mdash; - It's the planning meeting, it's important. - You're important. <br>&mdash; You're going to be fine, Craig. <br>&mdash; What! <br>&mdash; No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! <br>&mdash; Oh, afternoon. <br>&mdash; I'm so sorry, Michael, I don't know what happened, I've got no excuse. <br>&mdash; I think that's not what my screen is telling me, Mr Lang. <br>&mdash; What's he doing here? What are you doing here? <br>&mdash; If that's your attitude, Mr Lang, please take your custom elsewhere. <br>&mdash; No, no, no, that's one of my best clients! <br>&mdash; Craig, how are you feeling? Had some time to kill, <br>&mdash; I was curious, never worked in an office. <br>&mdash; - Never worked in anywhere. - You're insane! <br>&mdash; Leave off the Doctor, I love the Doctor. <br>&mdash; He was brilliant in the planning meeting. <br>&mdash; You went to the planning meeting? <br>&mdash; I was your representative. We don't need Mr Lang any more. Rude Mr Lang. <br>&mdash; - Here you go, and I found some custard creams! - Sophie, my hero. <br>&mdash; Hi. I went on the web, applied for a wildlife charity thing. <br>&mdash; They said I could always start as a volunteer straight away. <br>&mdash; - Should I do it? - Yeah, great, yeah, good, go for it. <br>&mdash; You look awful. About turn! Bed. Now. <br>&mdash; Who next? Oh, yes. <br>&mdash; Hello, Mr Joergensen. Can you hold? I have to eat a biscuit. <br>&mdash; What the hell? <br>&mdash; Have you been upstairs? <br>&mdash; Yes? <br>&mdash; You can do it. Show me what's up there? What's behind that door? <br>&mdash; Try to show me. Ohh, that doesn't make sense! <br>&mdash; Ever see anyone go up there? Lots of people? Good good. <br>&mdash; What kind of people? People who never come back down. That's very bad. <br>&mdash; Oh, hello. I can't take this any more. I want you to go! <br>&mdash; - You can have this back an' all. - What have I done? <br>&mdash; - For a start, talking to a cat. - Lots of people talk to cats. <br>&mdash; Everybody loves you, you're better at football than me, and my job, <br>&mdash; and now Sophie's all "Oh, monkeys, monkeys!" and then... there's that! <br>&mdash; It's art! A statement on modern society, "Ooh, ain't modern society awful?" <br>&mdash; You've been here three days, the three weirdest days of my life. <br>&mdash; - Your days will get a lot weirder if I go! - I can't do this any more! <br>&mdash; I can't leave this place. I'm like you, I can't see the point of anywhere else. <br>&mdash; Madrid, hah, what a dump! I have to stay. <br>&mdash; - No, you don't, you have to leave! - I can't go! Just get out! <br>&mdash; Right! Only way! I'm going to show you something, <br>&mdash; but ssh, really, ssh! <br>&mdash; Oh, I am going to regret this. OK, right... <br>&mdash; - First, general background! - Yargh! <br>&mdash; Ohhh! <br>&mdash; Ow! <br>&mdash; - You're a... - Yes. <br>&mdash; From... Ssh. You've got a TARDIS! Yes. Ssh! <br>&mdash; Eleventh! <br>&mdash; Right... OK, specific detail! <br>&mdash; Argh! <br>&mdash; Amy! Amy! <br>&mdash; You saw my ad in the paper shop window. <br>&mdash; Yes, with this right above it. Which is odd, because Amy hasn't written it yet. <br>&mdash; Time travel, it CAN happen. <br>&mdash; That's a scanner! <br>&mdash; You used non-technological technology of Lammasteen. <br>&mdash; Shut up! <br>&mdash; Please can you help me? <br>&mdash; Hi. <br>&mdash; - Please. Will you help me? - What's the matter, my love? <br>&mdash; Help you? <br>&mdash; Aaargh! <br>&mdash; - I am never, ever doing that ever ever again... Amy! - That's Amy Pond! <br>&mdash; Oh, of course, you can understand us now, hurrah. Got those plans yet? <br>&mdash; - Still searching for them! - I've worked it out with psychic help from a cat. <br>&mdash; - Cat? - Yes, I know he's got a time engine in the flat upstairs. <br>&mdash; He's using innocent people to try and launch it. <br>&mdash; Whenever he does, they get burnt up, hence the stain... <br>&mdash; - From the ceiling? - Well done, Craig. <br>&mdash; - And you, Miss Pond, nearly get thrown off into the Vortex. - Lovely! <br>&mdash; - People are dying up there? People are dying. People are dying. - Amy! <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; They're being killed! <br>&mdash; Someone's up there. <br>&mdash; 'Doctor!' Hang on! <br>&mdash; Craig, come on... someone's dying up there. <br>&mdash; It's Sophie. It's Sophie that's dying up there, it's Sophie! <br>&mdash; Doctor! Aaaaargh! <br>&mdash; - Where's Sophie! - Wait, wait! Amy? <br>&mdash; - Are you upstairs? - Just going in! - But you can't be upstairs. <br>&mdash; - Of course I can be upstairs! - Come on! <br>&mdash; No! I've got the plans, you cannot be upstairs, it's a one-storey building. <br>&mdash; 'There is no upstairs!' <br>&mdash; What? <br>&mdash; - What? - Oh. <br>&mdash; Oh, of course! <br>&mdash; The time engine isn't IN the flat. The time engine IS the flat! <br>&mdash; Someone's attempt to build a TARDIS. <br>&mdash; No, there's always been an upstairs. <br>&mdash; - Has there? Think about it! - Yes. <br>&mdash; - No. I don't... - Perception filter. <br>&mdash; It's more than a disguise. It tricks your memory. <br>&mdash; Sophie! <br>&mdash; Sophie! Oh, my God, Sophie! <br>&mdash; Craig! It's controlling her. It's willing her to <br>&mdash; touch the activator. - It's not going to have her! <br>&mdash; Ah! Deadlock seal! <br>&mdash; You've got to do something! <br>&mdash; - What? - Why's it let her go? <br>&mdash; - You will help me. - Right! Stop! Crashed ship, let's see. Hello. <br>&mdash; I'm Captain Troy Handsome of International Rescue. <br>&mdash; - Please state the nature of your emergency. - The ship has crashed. <br>&mdash; The crew are dead. A pilot is required. <br>&mdash; You're the emergency crash program. <br>&mdash; A hologram. You've been luring people up here so you can try them out. <br>&mdash; You will help me, you will help me, you will help me. <br>&mdash; - Craig! Where am I? - Hush! Human brains aren't <br>&mdash; strong enough, they just burn. You're stupid, <br>&mdash; you just keep trying. <br>&mdash; 17 people have been tried. <br>&mdash; 6,000,400,026 remain. <br>&mdash; - Seriously, what is going on? - The top floor of <br>&mdash; Craig's building is in reality an alien space ship, <br>&mdash; intent on slaughtering the population of this planet. Any questions? No, good. <br>&mdash; - Yes, I have questions. - The correct pilot has now been found. <br>&mdash; Yes, I was worried you'd say that. <br>&mdash; He means you, Doctor, doesn't he? <br>&mdash; The correct pilot has been found. <br>&mdash; The correct pilot has been found The correct pilot has been found. <br>&mdash; - What's happening? - It's pulling me in! I'm the new pilot! - Could you do it? <br>&mdash; Could you fly the ship safely? <br>&mdash; No, I'm way too much for this ship. <br>&mdash; My hand touches that panel, the planet <br>&mdash; doesn't blow up, the whole solar system does. <br>&mdash; The correct pilot has been found. <br>&mdash; No... worst choice ever, I promise you. Stop this! <br>&mdash; Doctor, it's getting worse. <br>&mdash; It doesn't want everyone. Craig, it didn't want you! <br>&mdash; I spoke to him and he said I couldn't help him! <br>&mdash; It didn't want Sophie before but now it does. What's changed? <br>&mdash; No! I gave her the idea of leaving! <br>&mdash; It's a machine that needs to leave, it wants people who want to escape! <br>&mdash; And you don't want to leave, Craig, you're Mr Sofa Man. <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; Craig, you can shut down the engine. <br>&mdash; Put your hand on the panel and concentrate on why you want to stay! <br>&mdash; - Craig, no! - Will it work? - Yes! - Are you sure? <br>&mdash; - Yes! - Is that a lie? <br>&mdash; Of course it's a lie! <br>&mdash; It's good enough for me. Geronimo! <br>&mdash; - Craig! - Doctor! <br>&mdash; Craig, what's keeping you here? Think about everything <br>&mdash; that makes you want to stay here! Why don't you want to leave? <br>&mdash; Sophie! And I don't want to leave Sophie! <br>&mdash; I can't leave Sophie! I love Sophie! <br>&mdash; I love you, too, Craig, you idiot! <br>&mdash; - Doctor! - Honestly, do you mean that? - Of course I mean it! Do you mean it? <br>&mdash; - I've always meant it. Seriously though, do you mean it? - Yes. <br>&mdash; - Ugh! - What about the monkeys? <br>&mdash; Oh, not now, not again! Craig, the planet's about to burn! <br>&mdash; For God's sake, kiss the girl! <br>&mdash; Kiss the girl! <br>&mdash; 'Doctor!' <br>&mdash; You've done it. <br>&mdash; Aha, you've done it! <br>&mdash; 'Oh, now the screen's just zeros! <br>&mdash; Now it's minus ones, minus twos, minus threes... ' <br>&mdash; Big yes! <br>&mdash; Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. <br>&mdash; Big no. <br>&mdash; - Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. - Did we switch it off? <br>&mdash; Emergency shutdown, it's imploding, everybody out, out, out! <br>&mdash; Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me... <br>&mdash; Help me. Help me. Help me... <br>&mdash; - Doctor! - Help me. Help me. Help me... <br>&mdash; Look at them. Didn't they see that? The whole top floor just vanished. <br>&mdash; Perception filter. There never was a top floor. <br>&mdash; - So have we spoiled our friendship, then? - Totally ruined it. <br>&mdash; And what about the monkeys? <br>&mdash; We could save them together, you know. <br>&mdash; Do whatever we want. I could see the point of Paris if you were there with me. <br>&mdash; First let's destroy our friendship completely. <br>&mdash; - Oi! - What, you're trying to sneak off? <br>&mdash; Yes, well, you were sort of... <br>&mdash; busy. <br>&mdash; - I want you to keep these. - Thank you. <br>&mdash; - Cos I might pop back soon, have another little stay. - No, you won't. <br>&mdash; I've been in your head, remember. But I still want you to keep them. <br>&mdash; - Thank you, Craig. - Thank you, Doctor. <br>&mdash; Sophie. Now then. 6,000,400,026 people in the world. <br>&mdash; That's the number to beat. <br>&mdash; Yeah. <br>&mdash; Back in time! You need to go to the paper shop, leave that note for me. <br>&mdash; Right little matchmaker, aren't you? Can't you find me a fella? <br>&mdash; Oh, rectifier's playing up again... Hold on. <br>&mdash; - You write the note and I'll change that will. - You got a pen? <br>&mdash; Make sure it's a red pen. <br>&mdash; There were cracks. <br>&mdash; Through some we saw silence and the end of all things. <br>&mdash; It's the crack in my wall. <br>&mdash; Two parts of space and time that should never have touched, pressed together. <br>&mdash; - All through the universe, rips in the continuum. - How could it be here? <br>&mdash; - How can it be following me? - I don't know yet, but I'm working it out. <br>&mdash; Some sort of space-time catechism? Big enough <br>&mdash; to put cracks in the universe. But what? <br>&mdash; The universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open, silence will fall. <br>&mdash; Pandorica... Ha! That's a fairytale! <br>&mdash; If it is real, it's here and it's opening. <br>&mdash; What is it? A box, a cage a prison. <br>&mdash; There was a goblin or a Trickster, or a warrior, <br>&mdash; soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. <br>&mdash; The most feared being in all the cosmos. <br>&mdash; The Pandorica. <br>&mdash; More than just a fairytale. <br>&mdash; - It's opening. - Your world has visitors. <br>&mdash; Daleks, Doctor, and Cyberships, Sontarans, <br>&mdash; Slitheen, Chelonian, Nestene, Drahvin, Sycorax... <br>&mdash; What's in there, what could justify all this? <br>&mdash; What are you? <br>&mdash; What could you possibly be? <br></div></body></html>
