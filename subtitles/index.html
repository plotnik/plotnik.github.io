      <h3>Doctor Who - 6x06-07 - The Almost People (2)</h3>
      
    &mdash; Ooh, we've gone all medieval. <br>&mdash; They're pumping something nasty off this island. <br>&mdash; Acid, they're pumping acid off this island. <br>&mdash; You're a factory, a 22nd century, army-owned factory. <br>&mdash; We're contractors and you're trespassers. <br>&mdash; I need to see your critical systems. <br>&mdash; Which one? You know which one. <br>&mdash; The Flesh. It's fully programmable matter. <br>&mdash; It's alive, so alive. You're piling your lives, your personalities,directly into it. <br>&mdash; You gave them your lives. Human lives are amazing. <br>&mdash; Are you surprised they walked off with them? <br>&mdash; This is... <br>&mdash; You're telling me. <br>&mdash; Why are you really here? <br>&mdash; They're monsters, mistakes. They have to be destroyed. <br>&mdash; If we want to live, then it's time to go to war. <br>&mdash; They're coming back in a big way. <br>&mdash; Yes, it's insane, and it's about to get even more insaner-er. <br>&mdash; Trust me, I'm the Doctor. <br>&mdash; OTHER DOCTOR: Aaaagh! <br>&mdash; What's happening? <br>&mdash; I wonder if we'll get back. <br>&mdash; Yes, one day... Aaagh! <br>&mdash; I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. <br>&mdash; The Flesh is struggling to cope with our past regenerations. Hold on! <br>&mdash; FOURTH DOCTOR'S VOICE: Would you like a jelly-baby? <br>&mdash; Why? Why!? Why? Why what? <br>&mdash; TENTH DOCTOR'S VOICE: Hello. I'm the Doctor. <br>&mdash; No, let it go, we've moved on! Hold on, hold on, you can stabilise! <br>&mdash; I've reversed the jelly-baby of the neutron flow. Would you like a... <br>&mdash; Doctor... Doctor... I'm... I'm the... <br>&mdash; I can't. No, listen, hold on. <br>&mdash; Hold on! No-o-o-o! <br>&mdash; Aaaagh! <br>&mdash; I think I liked it best when they were being noisy. Mm-hmm. <br>&mdash; Doctor, we need you. Get over here. <br>&mdash; Hello! <br>&mdash; Doctor! Cybermats. Do we have time for this? We make time. <br>&mdash; I'd like more proof that you're me. Cybermats? Created by the Cybermen.They kill by feeding off brainwaves. <br>&mdash; Are you sure there aren't any big guns with bits on? <br>&mdash; Yeah, big guns would be good right now. <br>&mdash; Why would we have guns? We're a factory. We mine. <br>&mdash; HISSING <br>&mdash; Acid. <br>&mdash; THUDDING <br>&mdash; Rory and Amy may not trust both of us. Are you thinkingwhat I'm thinking? <br>&mdash; Inevitably. I'm glad we're on the same... Wavelength.You see, great minds. <br>&mdash; Exactly. So, what's the plan? Save them all, <br>&mdash; humans and gangers. Sounds wonderful. Is that what you were thinking? It'sjust so inspiring to hear me say it. <br>&mdash; I know! Doctor, come on! <br>&mdash; So, what now, Doctor? Well, time to get cracking, Doctor. <br>&mdash; BOTH: Hello! Sorry... ..But we had to establish a few... <br>&mdash; ..Ground rules. Formulate a... Protocol. <br>&mdash; Very posh. A protocol between us. Otherwise... <br>&mdash; It gets horribly embarrassing. And potentially confusing. <br>&mdash; I'm glad you've solved the problem of confusing. <br>&mdash; That's sarcasm. She's very good at sarcasm. <br>&mdash; BOTH: Breathe! <br>&mdash; What? We have to get you off this island. And the gangers too. <br>&mdash; Would you like a memo? They're trying to kill us! They're scared. <br>&mdash; Doctor, we're trapped in here. I don't think so. <br>&mdash; The Flesh Bowl is fed by cabling from above.But where are the earthing conduits? <br>&mdash; All this piping must go down into a tunnel or a shaftor something, yes? With us? <br>&mdash; Yowza! An escape route. <br>&mdash; You know, I'm starting to get a sense of just how impressiveit is to hang out with me. <br>&mdash; Do we tend to say "Yowza"? <br>&mdash; That's enough, let it go, OK? We're under stress. <br>&mdash; SONIC WHIRRS <br>&mdash; Stop. <br>&mdash; Stop. Stop, stop! <br>&mdash; The army will send a recon team. We need to contact the mainland.What about Rory and Jen? <br>&mdash; They are both out there. Takes a long time to find someone in a maze. <br>&mdash; I bet you lot have got a computer map. <br>&mdash; If we can get power running, we can scan for them. <br>&mdash; SHE COUGHS <br>&mdash; Doctor, you said earlier to breathe. Very important, Pond. Breathe.I'm struggling to. <br>&mdash; Acid interacting with the stone. <br>&mdash; Creating an asphyxiant miasma. <br>&mdash; A what? Chokey gas. <br>&mdash; Extra heavy. If we can get above it... <br>&mdash; The evac tower. This way! <br>&mdash; Damned headaches. I'm so tired. <br>&mdash; They could be anywhere. <br>&mdash; How are we going to find them? Think about it. <br>&mdash; With all that gas, my guess would be the evac tower.Get above it. Try to get power up. <br>&mdash; So? Let's stop them. <br>&mdash; It's a narrow doorway. I could defend it easy enough. So can she. <br>&mdash; AMY COUGHS Ohh! <br>&mdash; I think I coughed so hard, I pulled a muscle or something. It's OK, <br>&mdash; it's easing off. BELL CHIMES <br>&mdash; It's midnight. It's Adam's birthday. <br>&mdash; My son's five. Happy birthday, bud. <br>&mdash; Happy birthday, Adam. <br>&mdash; He'll be so excited. <br>&mdash; Out of bed at the crack of dawn. <br>&mdash; It's funny, he's got this wee dance he does when he gets overexcited. <br>&mdash; Listen to me. I tried to block the memories,but now I know I must remember. <br>&mdash; It's the eyes. The eyes are the last to go. <br>&mdash; What are you talking about? <br>&mdash; When they destroy us, the eyes are the last things to melt. <br>&mdash; And there's one question in those eyes - why? <br>&mdash; Why should we suffer for the sake of human beings? <br>&mdash; I heard in India, there's over ten million gangers. <br>&mdash; We can reach out, inspire them to rise up. <br>&mdash; Revolution? <br>&mdash; Look, I just...I just want to be left to live in peace, Jen. <br>&mdash; They will melt you. <br>&mdash; Have you become so human that you've forgotten the truth? <br>&mdash; Don't you remember all the times you were decommissioned,or should I say executed? No. <br>&mdash; We don't remember. Well, I do. <br>&mdash; It's us or them. <br>&mdash; She's right. <br>&mdash; I have a plan. <br>&mdash; And it'll destroy them all. <br>&mdash; Can you really get the power back? There's always some powerfloating around. <br>&mdash; Sticking to the wires, like bits of lint. <br>&mdash; Can you stop finishing each other's... Sentences? No probs. Yes. <br>&mdash; Hang on. You said that the TARDIS was stuck in acid,so won't she be damaged? <br>&mdash; Nah. She's a tough old thing. Tough, old, sexy. <br>&mdash; No, tough, dependable, sexy. <br>&mdash; Come on. OK, how can...how can you both be real? Well, because...we are. I'm the Doctor. <br>&mdash; So am I. We contain the knowledge of over 900 years of experience. <br>&mdash; We both wear the same bowtie, which is cool. Because bowtiesare... And always will be. <br>&mdash; But you weren't linked up to the Flesh. <br>&mdash; It must've been after I examined it. Thus, a new, genuine Doctorwas created. Ta-da! <br>&mdash; But one of you was here first. <br>&mdash; After the Flesh scanned me, I had an accident with a puddle of acid. <br>&mdash; Now new shoes, a situation which did not confront me learned self here. <br>&mdash; That satisfy you, Pond? <br>&mdash; Don't call me Pond, please. <br>&mdash; What? You definitely feel more affection for him than me. <br>&mdash; No, I... Look, you're fine and everything, but he is the Doctor. <br>&mdash; No offence. Being almost the Doctor is pretty damn impressive. <br>&mdash; Being almost the Doctor's like being no Doctor at all.Don't overreact. <br>&mdash; You might as well call me...Smith. Smith? John Smith.Communication a go-go! <br>&mdash; Find Rory! Show me the scanny tracky screen. <br>&mdash; Come on, Rory, let's be having you. <br>&mdash; There's no sign of him anywhere. <br>&mdash; Come on, baby, show yourself. <br>&mdash; You're right, there's power. <br>&mdash; Well, boys, I don't know much, but I know my own minds. <br>&mdash; She'll be on the comlink to the mainland. <br>&mdash; St John's calling. Emergency Alpha. <br>&mdash; Let's see if we can intercept. <br>&mdash; 'St John's calling the mainland. Are you receiving me, Captain? Come in'. <br>&mdash; We'll never get a signal through this storm. <br>&mdash; St John's calling the mainland. Come in, this is urgent. <br>&mdash; 'We're just about reading you, St John's. How are you doing?We've had all kinds of trouble here'. <br>&mdash; 'Request immediate evacuation. We're under attack.The storm's affected our gangers.' <br>&mdash; They're running amok. <br>&mdash; 'Your gangers?' Yes, our gangers are attacking us. <br>&mdash; We need you to take us off the island immediatelyand wipe them out. <br>&mdash; 'Copy that, St John's. Shuttle's despatched. Hang on'. <br>&mdash; You'll need to airlift us off the roof of the evac tower. <br>&mdash; 'And Captain, any further transmission sent by me mustcome with the following codeword. <br>&mdash; 'I'm typing it, in case they're listening in.' <br>&mdash; Ooh. See how smart I am? That's why I'm paid the big bucks. <br>&mdash; 'Got it. We'll swing in, get you out and decommission the Flesh'. <br>&mdash; Jennifer's right. We're going to have to fight if we want to survive. <br>&mdash; COMPUTER: 'Thermostatic override rejected. <br>&mdash; 'Can only be operated by recognised source'. <br>&mdash; I am recognised! I'm Jennifer Lucas! <br>&mdash; We'ev got to get out of here. We're not leaving without them. <br>&mdash; I want 'em found too, but it's about casualties, innit? <br>&mdash; What are you doing? Making a phone call. Who to?No-one yet. It's on delay. <br>&mdash; Why exactly are you making a phone call? <br>&mdash; Because, Amy, I am and always will be the optimist, <br>&mdash; the hoper of far-flung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams. <br>&mdash; The wheels are in motion. Done. <br>&mdash; You know, really, there can be only one. <br>&mdash; Hmm? Nothing. Carry on. Be amazing. <br>&mdash; BREATHING NOISE <br>&mdash; BREATHING NOISE CONTINUES <br>&mdash; Amy? What happened? <br>&mdash; It's her again. It's who again? There's a woman I keep seeing,a woman with an eyepatch, <br>&mdash; and she has this habit of sliding walls open and staring at me. <br>&mdash; Doctor? It's nothing. Doesn't seem like nothing. <br>&mdash; It's a time memory. Like a mirage. It's nothing to worry about. <br>&mdash; It's in my head... <br>&mdash; Hey, hold on! Don't let him go. Leave it to me. <br>&mdash; I'm sorry. What I said about you being almost the Doctor, <br>&mdash; it's just really hard, because I've been through so much with him. <br>&mdash; I've even seen... I've even seen the moment of his... <br>&mdash; Can you die? <br>&mdash; If you really are the same, then you can die. <br>&mdash; You can be killed, and... I might have seen that happen. <br>&mdash; Why? Why? Because you invited us to see it. Your death! <br>&mdash; Why? You're hurting me. It's all the eyes say! Why? <br>&mdash; I can feel them as they work each day, knowing the time was comingfor them to be thrown away again. <br>&mdash; "Not again, please!" <br>&mdash; And then they are destroyed and they feel death, and allthey can say is, "Why?" <br>&mdash; Why? <br>&mdash; Keep him away from me! <br>&mdash; Did you sense it? <br>&mdash; Briefly. Not as strong as you. <br>&mdash; Amy, I'm sorry. No, you keep away! We can't trust you. <br>&mdash; It would appear I can connect to the Flesh. Well, you are Flesh.I'm beginning to understand <br>&mdash; what it needs. What YOU want. You are it. It's much more powerful <br>&mdash; than we thought. The Flesh can grow, correct?Its cells can divide. <br>&mdash; Well, now it wants to do that at will. <br>&mdash; It wants revenge. <br>&mdash; It's in pain, angry. It wants revenge. <br>&mdash; I was right, you're not the Doctor. You can't ever be.You're just a copy. <br>&mdash; Doctor, it might be best if you stayed over there for now, hmm? <br>&mdash; Hold on a minute, I thought I'd explained this.I'm him, he's me. <br>&mdash; Doctor, we have no issue with you. But when it comes to your ganger... <br>&mdash; Don't be so absurd. <br>&mdash; Buzzer? Sure, boss. <br>&mdash; Take a seat, mate. <br>&mdash; Nice barrel, very comfy. <br>&mdash; Why not? <br>&mdash; Is this really what you want? <br>&mdash; Help me! No! Get away! Jen? <br>&mdash; Jen! <br>&mdash; Rory? I'm sorry. <br>&mdash; She found me. Rory, listen to me. <br>&mdash; Don't listen to her! <br>&mdash; I'm Jennifer Lucas. This woman is Flesh. <br>&mdash; RADIO: 'We're right above you, but we can't get low enough. <br>&mdash; 'Gamma static could fry our nav-controls. Sit tight. <br>&mdash; 'We'll get to you. Just...' <br>&mdash; Hello? Can you hear me? I can't find Rory. I'm going out there. <br>&mdash; We could use the sonic. Humans and gangers give off different signals. <br>&mdash; The sonic knows gangers are different, so the other Doctoris different. He is the Doctor. <br>&mdash; Not to me. I can tell. Sure you're not prejudiced?Nice try, but I know, OK? <br>&mdash; We've been through too much. You're my Doctor. End of. <br>&mdash; So one of you is human, and one of you I sat with and talked with. <br>&mdash; Why can't you just tell me the truth? <br>&mdash; The Doctor wants you to live and I'm with him all the way. <br>&mdash; That's a lovely idea, Rory, but the Flesh want to kill us now. <br>&mdash; You're limping. You're not. <br>&mdash; So? So what? You think a ganger can't put on a limp? <br>&mdash; Show me your leg. <br>&mdash; It got burnt while I was in the harness. <br>&mdash; She's lying! She's telling you what you want to hear!Look, you can't fake a burn. <br>&mdash; No! No, you don't... <br>&mdash; Stop it! Fighting each other is pointless. Come on.Please, please stop! <br>&mdash; Jen...both Jens, stop it! <br>&mdash; No! <br>&mdash; She...she attacked me. I didn't... <br>&mdash; I knew you'd find me. We're in this together, Rory,and we've got to trust each other. <br>&mdash; OK, come on. Let's go. <br>&mdash; Hey, there's a camera up. We've got a visual. <br>&mdash; That's Rory and Jennifer. <br>&mdash; They're heading for the thermostatic room. Let's go get them. <br>&mdash; Hang on. We can't let him go. Are you crazy? Am I crazy, Doctor? <br>&mdash; You did once plumb your brain into the core of an entire planet <br>&mdash; just to halt its orbit and win a bet. He can't rescue them. <br>&mdash; I'm going. Do you know, I want him to go. <br>&mdash; And I'm rather adamant. <br>&mdash; Well, then, he'll need company, right, boss? <br>&mdash; It's fine. I'll handle it. <br>&mdash; Thank you, Buzzer. It'll be all right. <br>&mdash; I'll find him. <br>&mdash; I need you to trust him. Can you do that for me, Amy? <br>&mdash; And what if you're wrong? <br>&mdash; This is the thermostatic chamber. <br>&mdash; We can stir the oxygen supply from here. What? <br>&mdash; We're going to choke to death if we don't clean this air. <br>&mdash; Keep a look out in case of gangers. <br>&mdash; HE COUGHS <br>&mdash; Rory! <br>&mdash; What's wrong? It's this wheel. It's just too tough for a girlto turn. Are you feeling strong? <br>&mdash; I'll break out the big guns. <br>&mdash; This first. <br>&mdash; COMPUTER: 'Human source recognised. <br>&mdash; 'Thermostatic override granted'. <br>&mdash; These temperature gauges are rising. <br>&mdash; Jennifer and Rory must have shut off the underground cooling vents.Why do that? They'll kill us. <br>&mdash; There's a million gallons of boiling acid under our feet... <br>&mdash; And now it's heating up the whole island. How long till it blows? <br>&mdash; Gangers or no gangers, we need to get the hell out of here. Shuttle!We need evac. Where are you? <br>&mdash; Can you hear me? Can you...? Cleaves? <br>&mdash; Cleaves, sit down. I'm fine. <br>&mdash; You don't look good. Monsters never do. <br>&mdash; I'm fine. I remember medics doing tests. <br>&mdash; I'm waiting for results, so let it go. <br>&mdash; It's a very deep parietal clot. <br>&mdash; How can you possib...? <br>&mdash; Inoperable? On Earth, yes. Well, seeing as Earth is all that's on... <br>&mdash; ..offer...hmm. <br>&mdash; I'm no healthy spring chicken, and you're no weatherman. Right? <br>&mdash; Something just cracked. I heard it. Yeah, we can't stay here, let's go. <br>&mdash; Let's shift! Cleaves to Shuttle. We need to move, and we can't becollected from the evac tower. <br>&mdash; 'Give us the codeword'. The codeword is... <br>&mdash; Cleaves? Cleaves, it's dead, it's dead. <br>&mdash; We need to get back downstairs and get those vents back on, come on. <br>&mdash; This is our chance. I can reroute the shuttle to the courtyard.You can't guess the codeword. <br>&mdash; I can, Jimmy, because I created the codeword. <br>&mdash; Shuttle, do you read me? This is Foreman Cleaves. <br>&mdash; 'You got cut off. Say again? What's the request?' <br>&mdash; You need to reroute and pick us up from the courtyard. <br>&mdash; 'Courtyard - as soon as we can. Give me the codeword'. <br>&mdash; Shuttle, the codeword is "Bad Boy". I repeat, "Bad Boy". <br>&mdash; 'Copy that. The courtyard. Still want us to take careof those gangers?' Negative. <br>&mdash; They've all been incinerated. <br>&mdash; Bad Boy? Good call. <br>&mdash; Yeah, well, it wasn't luck. We're the same person. <br>&mdash; This room's always sealed. Power surge must have thrown the bolts. <br>&mdash; What is that? <br>&mdash; Discarded Flesh. Faulty, probably. <br>&mdash; Just thrown away. Look at them. <br>&mdash; One of my old gangers. <br>&mdash; Left to rot, fully conscious. <br>&mdash; Can you imagine what kind of hell they're in? <br>&mdash; But Cleaves, the company, how could they do this? How could they? <br>&mdash; Who are the real monsters? <br>&mdash; We can't let this carry on. <br>&mdash; Jen, we have to make people see! <br>&mdash; OK, Rory. I have an idea. <br>&mdash; You came for me. We have a bond. Right? <br>&mdash; We trust each other. Yeah. <br>&mdash; So trust me on this. <br>&mdash; I'm getting something. Is it human? Yeah, it's human.But it's fading. It's fading. <br>&mdash; This is bad. Fading is very... <br>&mdash; bad. Aagh! The signal's gone. She's...dead. <br>&mdash; She was hanging onto the edge of life and she just... just slipped away. <br>&mdash; Oh, Jennifer, I'm so sorry. <br>&mdash; She's been out here for hours. <br>&mdash; But if the real Jen's been lying out here... <br>&mdash; Rory's in trouble. <br>&mdash; Sorry, pal, it's boss's orders. Us and them, innit? <br>&mdash; Ah. The eyes have it. <br>&mdash; Why are they here? <br>&mdash; To accuse...us. <br>&mdash; Ignore them. It's not far. <br>&mdash; I should have been a postman like me dad. <br>&mdash; Shh. I'm here. I'm here. <br>&mdash; I'm with you. <br>&mdash; I know, it hurts. <br>&mdash; I'm sorry. <br>&mdash; Go to sleep. <br>&mdash; Sleep. <br>&mdash; You killed her. <br>&mdash; You killed our Jen. <br>&mdash; And I'm stronger, Buzz. <br>&mdash; I can grow! <br>&mdash; BUZZER SCREAMS <br>&mdash; It's a chemical chain reaction now. I can't stop it. This placeis going to blow sky high. <br>&mdash; Exactly how long have we got? An hour? Five seconds? <br>&mdash; Er, somewhere in between. <br>&mdash; EXPLOSION, KLAXON, HISSING Out! <br>&mdash; All right? Oh, Rory! Oh, Rory. <br>&mdash; There's a way out. Jennifer found it. A secret tunnel under the crypt. <br>&mdash; From the crypt? It's not on the schematics. <br>&mdash; It runs right out of the monastery. Maybe even under the TARDIS, Doctor.Follow me. <br>&mdash; Got anything for a sore head? <br>&mdash; This is how they'll always treat us. Do you see now? <br>&mdash; After all, you're one of us... Doctor. <br>&mdash; Call me Smith. John Smith. <br>&mdash; We can't leave without Buzzer. <br>&mdash; I'll go back for him. Doctor, look... <br>&mdash; I haven't been quite straight with you... Rory! <br>&mdash; We don't need to lock them up. We should just show themwhat we've found. <br>&mdash; I don't think so. <br>&mdash; Rory Pond, Roranicus Pondicus! Rory! What the hell are you playing at? <br>&mdash; They've been throwing away old Flesh and leaving it to rot, alive! <br>&mdash; I think the world should see that. Rory, there is no time. <br>&mdash; This factory's about to explode! Are you sure about this?Cos I'm not. Let them out. <br>&mdash; The little girl got strong. <br>&mdash; What? The little girl lost on the moors in her red wellies?Looking for a way home? <br>&mdash; Well, she got strong, Rory. I told you, remember? <br>&mdash; But that wasn't...it was the other Jennifer that told meabout being a little girl. <br>&mdash; Oh? What other Jennifer? <br>&mdash; Well, the... the... wait, you tricked me? Let me go, I'll open the door. <br>&mdash; Let me... I'm sorry! <br>&mdash; We have to be free. I'm sorry too, Miranda. <br>&mdash; Of all the humans in the world, you had to pick the one with the clot. <br>&mdash; But hey, them's the breaks. Welcome to the human race. <br>&mdash; This is going to overheat and fill the room with acid,just as a point of interest. <br>&mdash; And we can't stop it? <br>&mdash; Just as a point of interest, no. <br>&mdash; You created another ganger just to trick me. <br>&mdash; You tricked me. When I found you, you were both Flesh and you trickedme into trusting you! <br>&mdash; Jen's dead, isn't she? She's gone, Rory. Gone. <br>&mdash; RADIO: 'Shuttle, we're dropping down on our approach. Stand by for evac'. <br>&mdash; The humans will be melted, as they deserve. <br>&mdash; And then the factory will be destroyed. <br>&mdash; Once we get to the mainland, the real battle begins. <br>&mdash; The humans won't stand a chance. <br>&mdash; You're one of us, Doctor. Join the revolution. <br>&mdash; I've got to go and get them out. <br>&mdash; It'll never hold her. If you have a better plan, I'm all ears. <br>&mdash; In fact, if you have a better plan, <br>&mdash; I'll take you to a planet where EVERYONE is all ears. <br>&mdash; Doctor, we can't just let them die. <br>&mdash; Ring Ring! Doctor! <br>&mdash; Ring Ring! <br>&mdash; The acid's eating through. <br>&mdash; Stay! OK. <br>&mdash; PHONE RINGS Ah, that'll be the phone. <br>&mdash; Somebody get the phone. Jimmy, get the phone. No?Fine, I'll get the phone. Stay put. <br>&mdash; 'Thank you for booking your holo-call with Morpeth Jet...' Ha! <br>&mdash; Hello, Adam, I'm the Doctor. Well, Other Doctor. <br>&mdash; Or Smith. It's complicated and boring. Anyway, who cares,it's your birthday! <br>&mdash; Yay! Yay! Now, have you been getting up very early and jumping on the bed?Yes, really high. <br>&mdash; I expect chocolate for breakfast. If you don't feel sickby mid-morning, <br>&mdash; you're not doing it right. Now, I think you want to speakto Dad. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! <br>&mdash; Daddy? <br>&mdash; You'll do, Jimmy. What does the other Jimmy matter now?You're both the same dad, aren't you? <br>&mdash; Come on, Adam's waiting. <br>&mdash; Daddy? Daddy, what's that rumbly noise? <br>&mdash; What's going on, Daddy? Daddy? <br>&mdash; You've tricked him into an act of weakness, Doctor. <br>&mdash; No, I've helped him into an act of humanity. <br>&mdash; Anyone else like the sound of that? Act of humanity. <br>&mdash; Dicken, drain the acid well in crypt one. Don't you dare! <br>&mdash; I've had it with this! <br>&mdash; What's the point in this ridiculous war? <br>&mdash; Look at you, Jen. <br>&mdash; You were a sweet kid. <br>&mdash; Look at you now. <br>&mdash; Stuff of nightmares. <br>&mdash; I don't want my world populated by monsters. <br>&mdash; You can't stop the factory from melting down, "boss". <br>&mdash; I'll take revenge on humanity with or without you. <br>&mdash; It doesn't have to be about revenge. It can be so much better than that. <br>&mdash; Aaagh! <br>&mdash; Let me through! <br>&mdash; There's nothing we can do. The acid's reached his heart. <br>&mdash; Hang in there, mate. I'm quite handsome from this angle. <br>&mdash; I'm...sorry. <br>&mdash; I'm the fake. <br>&mdash; Adam deserves his real dad. <br>&mdash; Shut up. What do you want me to do? <br>&mdash; Anything, just say. <br>&mdash; The way things are, mate... <br>&mdash; ..it's up to you now. <br>&mdash; Be a dad. <br>&mdash; You remember how. <br>&mdash; Jimmy Wicks...you're a dad. <br>&mdash; Daddy? Where's my daddy? <br>&mdash; Daddy, it's me! <br>&mdash; Hey, sunshine! What are you up to? <br>&mdash; Opening all my presents. Haha, good lad. <br>&mdash; You have fun today. <br>&mdash; And remember, your dad... <br>&mdash; he loves you very, very much. <br>&mdash; When are you coming home? <br>&mdash; Daddy's coming home today, Adam. <br>&mdash; Yay! <br>&mdash; Now we need to move. <br>&mdash; SHE PANTS <br>&mdash; DOOR OPENING <br>&mdash; Run. Run. Run! <br>&mdash; Ooh, roof's going to give. <br>&mdash; We have to stop her. This door doesn't lock. <br>&mdash; No, but the far one does. <br>&mdash; MONSTER SNARLS <br>&mdash; Aaagh! <br>&mdash; No! <br>&mdash; Here she comes. <br>&mdash; Oh, she does like to make an entrance! <br>&mdash; Move! Go, go, go, go! <br>&mdash; Get on board! Go! I'm not leaving. <br>&mdash; Go. <br>&mdash; Now's our chance. I have to stay. Hold this door closed. <br>&mdash; Give you time to dematerialise. Oh, don't be crazy.OK, what happens to you? <br>&mdash; Well, this place is just about to explode. But I can stop her. <br>&mdash; Both of you can survive this, OK? <br>&mdash; Or perhaps you think I should stay instead... Mr Smith? <br>&mdash; No, of course not. But look, this man, I've flown with him, you know? <br>&mdash; And you are amazing and yeah, I misjudged you, but you're not him.I'm sorry. <br>&mdash; Amy, we swapped shoes. <br>&mdash; I'm the Doctor. And I'm the Flesh. <br>&mdash; You can't be. <br>&mdash; You're the real him. No, I'm not, and I haven't been all along. What?I'm the original Doctor, Amy. <br>&mdash; We had to know if we were truly the same. It was vitalwe learn about The Flesh. <br>&mdash; And we could only do that through your eyes. <br>&mdash; I never thought it possible. <br>&mdash; What? <br>&mdash; You're twice the man I thought you were. <br>&mdash; Push, Amy. <br>&mdash; But only when she tells you to. <br>&mdash; Amy, come on! <br>&mdash; Well, my death arrives, I suppose. But this one, we're not invited to. <br>&mdash; Pardon? Nothing. Your molecular memory can survive this, you know.It may not be the end. <br>&mdash; If I turn up to nick all your biscuits, you'll know you were right. <br>&mdash; HE CHUCKLES <br>&mdash; Doctor! <br>&mdash; No, please... <br>&mdash; You too, Cleaves, off you pop. I'm staying. <br>&mdash; This is not the time for grand gestures. Says the king of grandgestures! I'm not going anywhere. <br>&mdash; Foreman Miranda Cleaves, marvellous! Beware of imitations. <br>&mdash; Clear off out of here, the lot of you! <br>&mdash; This will dissolve her. And us too. <br>&mdash; There may be a way back from this. From being vaporised? How?Don't know. Let's find out, eh? <br>&mdash; Geronimo! <br>&mdash; The energy from the TARDIS will stabilise the gangers for good.They're people now. <br>&mdash; And what happens to me? I still have this. <br>&mdash; Ah, that's not a problem. I have something for that.It's small and red <br>&mdash; and tastes like burnt onions, ha! <br>&mdash; But it'll get rid of your blood clot. <br>&mdash; Happy endings. <br>&mdash; Hey! Hello, bud. <br>&mdash; Daddy, you're back! Hello, my boy! How are you doing? <br>&mdash; You really want us to do this? <br>&mdash; Your company's telling the world that the situation is over. <br>&mdash; You need to get in there and tell them that the situation'sonly just begun. <br>&mdash; Make them understand what they're doing to the Flesh. Make them stop. <br>&mdash; Dicken, remember, people are good. In their bones, truly good. <br>&mdash; Don't hate them, will you? <br>&mdash; How can I hate them? I'm one of them now. <br>&mdash; Yeah, and just remember, people died. Don't let that be in vain. <br>&mdash; Make what you say in that room count. <br>&mdash; Ready? <br>&mdash; Side by side. You got it, boss. <br>&mdash; REPORTER: Have the army dealt with the imposters? <br>&mdash; You OK? <br>&mdash; I said breathe, Pond, remember? Well, breathe. <br>&mdash; Why? Breathe. Ohh! <br>&mdash; Whoa. Oh! What's wrong with her? <br>&mdash; Get her into the TARDIS. <br>&mdash; AMY GASPS IN PAIN <br>&mdash; Doctor! What is happening to her? <br>&mdash; Contractions. <br>&mdash; Contractions? She's going into labour. <br>&mdash; Did he say...? No, of course he didn't. <br>&mdash; Rory, I don't like this. Ow! <br>&mdash; You'll have to explain this. What, the birds and the bees?She's having a baby. <br>&mdash; I needed to see the Flesh in its early days. That's why we were therein the first place. <br>&mdash; I was going to drop you off for fish and chips first, <br>&mdash; but things happened and there was stuff and shenanigans.Beautiful word, shenanigans. <br>&mdash; It hurts! But you're OK? <br>&mdash; Breathe. I needed enough information <br>&mdash; to block the signal to the Flesh. <br>&mdash; What signal? <br>&mdash; The signal to you. <br>&mdash; Doctor? <br>&mdash; Stand away from her, Rory. <br>&mdash; Why? No! And why? Given what we've learned,I'll be as humane as I can, <br>&mdash; but I need to do this and you need to stand away! <br>&mdash; No. <br>&mdash; No! <br>&mdash; Doctor, I am frightened. I'm properly, properly scared. Don't be. <br>&mdash; Hold on. We're coming for you, I swear it. Whatever happens, howeverhard, however far, we will find you. <br>&mdash; I'm right here! <br>&mdash; No, you're not. You haven't been here for a long, long time. <br>&mdash; Oh, no! <br>&mdash; Well, dear, you're ready to pop, aren't you? <br>&mdash; Little one's on its way. <br>&mdash; Here it comes. <br>&mdash; Pu-u-u-ush! <br>&mdash; SHE SCREAMS <br>&mdash; Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd <br>&mdash; E-mail - subtitling@bbc.co.uk <br></div></body></html>
